Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the choice of interoperability approach for
   the provision of disaster management systems (DMS) when resources are
   distributed across districts, and in times of disaster resources can be
   shared. The degree to which sharing (a spillover) can be coordinated
   efficiently depends on resource interoperability. In this public sector
   setting, we model the provisioning of DMS as the choice between
   interoperability approaches; in decreasing order of centralization they
   are integrated, unified, and federated. A unique feature of our setting
   is that the interoperability approach is a collective decision by
   districts. Districts choose their own DMS resources and interoperability
   effort, and face different interoperability efficiency and technology
   misfit costs depending on the interoperability approach.
   We find that any approach can be an equilibrium depending on
   interoperability efficiency, and that when the social optimum deviates
   from the equilibrium the socially optimal approach is more centralized.
   When subsidies and taxes are implemented, the socially optimal
   interoperability approach can be achieved with budget balance. When only
   subsidies can be used, the socially optimal approach can be achieved but
   only under certain interoperability efficiency and misfit cost
   conditions is there a net social gain. Having an initial level of
   interoperability causes the equilibrium interoperability approach to
   shift toward a less centralized one. Our results generalize to other
   settings characterized by interoperability concerns, collective
   decisions, and spillovers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we evaluate the reasons for the failure of information
   systems in public universities. To that end, we start by presenting a
   hierarchical structure of criteria after reviewing related studies, and
   dividing the criteria into the categories of project management,

   To assess the weight of the criteria in the proposed framework, we
   collect the opinions of a sample of information technology experts
   working in different public universities in Iran, using an online
   questionnaire that is based on the best-worst method (BWM). By analyzing
   the weight of the criteria, we can reveal that misfit of information
   systems software (closely followed by lack of top management support and
   unsuccessful monitoring and measurement) has the greatest impact on the
   failure of information systems in the public universities of Iran. The

Abstract = {{Support vector regression (SVR) method becomes the state of the art
   machine learning method for data regression due to its excellent
   generalization performance on many real-world problems. It is well-known
   that the standard SVR determines the regressor using a predefined
   epsilon tube around the data points in which the points lying outside
   the tube contribute to the errors whereas the inside points are simply
   ignored. To measure the data misfit as stated, the epsilon insensitive
   function is introduced as a loss function. In comparison with the
   popular quadratic loss function, it is robust but only continuous and
   therefore numerical minimization is difficult. However, as a combination
   of robust treatment to large errors and showing quadratic treatment to
   small errors, Huber function is used in the literature to measure the
   data misfit having the smooth property that it is differentiable
   everywhere. In this study, we propose a novel robust Huber SVR (HSVR)
   formulation in primal where the regressor is made as flat as possible by
   considering the regularization term in L1-norm. Since the regularization
   term is non-smooth and therefore by replacing it with smooth
   approximation functions, new problem formulation is obtained which is
   solved then by functional iterative method. Tests were performed on few
   synthetic and real world data sets whose results confirm the suitability
   and effectiveness of the proposed robust model.}},

Title = {{Convolution Coding and Amplitude Attenuation-Based Full Waveform
   Inversion}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{182996-183013}},
Abstract = {{Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful method to reconstruct the
   properties of the subsurface media. However, the standard FWI is a
   non-unique and ill-posed inversion problem, which requires proper
   techniques to avoid cycle skipping phenomena. Sufficient low-frequencies
   in the observed data and a good initial model are helpful to mitigate
   cycle skipping problem, but they are hard to be provided in real cases.
   Therefore, to reduce the non-linearity and improve the convergence of
   FWI, we developed a novel approach inspired by using the convolutional
   neural network to mitigate the cycle skipping problem. We use the
   1-dimentional (1-D) convolution kernels of different lengths to convolve
   each seismic trace of the synthetic and observed data to extract the
   different features of each time sample, and then we use the Sigmoid
   function to encode each time sample of the synthetic and observed data
   according to the polarity of the features. By comparing the coding
   similarity for the time sample of the synthetic and observed data at the
   corresponding time, we can identify which part of the synthetic data is
   well matched with the observed data and which part is mismatched. For
   the mismatched synthetic data, we attenuate them to reduce their
   interference on the gradient, thereby the cycle skipping problem can be
   mitigated. In this case, we use the global-correlation misfit function
   which behaves better in mitigating the interference of the incorrect
   amplitude information and highlighting the phase information with weaker
   non-linearity. In addition, the convolution coding and amplitude
   attenuation-based method has a strong anti-noise capability and can be
   combined with the encoded multisource scheme to save the computational
   costs. Marmousi model tests demonstrate that convolution coding and
   amplitude attenuation-based FWI behaves better than the standard FWI in
   generating convergent inverted result.}},

Title = {{A Simple and Robust Total Variation-Based Inversion Scheme for Transient
   Electromagnetic Data}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{16539-16549}},
Abstract = {{Transient electromagnetic (TEM) data are conveniently inverted to
   visualized underground structure with the widely used Occam \& x2019;s
   inversion. However, in sedimentary environments, Occam \& x2019;s
   inversion performs poorly in reproducing the sharp boundaries as it
   produces smoothed results of subsurface geophysical properties. Here, we
   develop a simple and robust total variation (TV) based inversion scheme
   for TEM data to preserve sharp boundaries and improve the accuracy of
   recovered underground structure. To solve the standard L2-TV
   optimization problem, we propose a reconstructing minimization (RM)
   approach. The TV-based inversion scheme is divided into two phases. In
   Phase I the misfit is brought down to a desired level utilizing Occam \&
   x2019;s inversion. In Phase II we utilize RM approach to implement TV
   regularization until the convergent result is achieved. Taking advantage
   of the excellent stability of Occam \& x2019;s inversion, the TV-based
   inversion scheme has the characteristics of robustness to different
   initial models. The switch process between Occam \& x2019;s inversion
   and the RM approach is rather simple to realize due to their similar
   solution forms. The synthetic and field data examples validate the
   efficiency and accuracy of the proposed TV-based inversion scheme. We
   further present a novel analysis based on reconstruction of stabilizer
   to illustrate the reason for their distinctive behaviors of TV-based
   inversion and Occam \& x2019;s inversion.}},

Abstract = {{The unique features of current and upcoming energy systems, namely, high
   penetration of uncertain renewables, unpredictable customer
   participation, and purposeful manipulation of meter readings, all
   highlight the need for fast and robust power system state estimation
   (PSSE). In the absence of noise, PSSE is equivalent to solving a system
   of quadratic equations, which, also related to power flow analysis, is
   NP-hard in general. Assuming the availability of all power flow and
   voltage magnitude measurements, this paper first suggests a simple
   algebraic technique to transform the power flows into rank-one
   measurements, for which the \$\textbackslash{}ell \_1\$-based misfit is
   minimized. To uniquely cope with the nonconvexity and nonsmoothness of
   \$\textbackslash{}ell \_1\$-based PSSE, a deterministic proximal-linear
   solver is developed based on composite optimization, whose
   generalization using stochastic gradients is discussed too. This paper
   also develops conditions on the \$\textbackslash{}ell \_1\$-based loss
   function such that exact recovery and quadratic convergence of the
   proposed scheme are guaranteed. Simulated tests using several IEEE
   benchmark test systems under different settings corroborate our
   theoretical findings, as well as the fast convergence and robustness of

Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{124}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Competing platforms with hardware and content differentiation may adopt
   a one-way compatibility strategy, in which one platform owner allows its
   hardware users to purchase the competitor's content service, whereas the
   competitor does not. Moreover, the platform owners can choose a resale
   model or agency model. When a platform owner adopts the agency model, a
   platform-performance investment may force content providers to incur
   certain costs to ensure enhanced performance. In this paper, we develop
   a stylized model to investigate the effects of a platform-performance
   investment on a business-model decision by examining a platform
   ecosystem that consists of a unit mass of users, a content provider, and
   two downstream competing platform owners. We find that, when the unit
   misfit cost of hardware is much less than that of the content, if the
   royalty rate is too high (low), the agency (resale) model will be
   adopted by both platform owners. If the royalty rate is neither too high
   nor too low, the owners will adopt a different business model. When the
   unit misfit cost of hardware is weakly less than that of the content,
   the platform owners' business-model decision is jointly determined by
   the relative platform-performance investment efficiency and the royalty
   rate. Moreover, when both platform owners adopt the agency model, the
   price is not always higher than that when they use the resale model due
   to the negative effect of the performance investment. Finally, we
   present the condition under which the content provider would be better
   off if the provider is granted the right to change the business model by
   one platform owner.}},

Abstract = {{Seismology has changed character since 50 years ago when the full
   wavefield could be determined. Partial differential equations (PDE)
   started to be used in the inverse process of finding properties of the
   interior of the earth. In this paper, we will review earlier techniques
   focusing on Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which is a large-scale
   non-convex PDE constrained optimization problem. The minimization of the
   objective function is usually coupled with the adjoint state method,
   which also includes the solution to an adjoint wave equation. The
   least-squares (L-2) norm is the conventional objective function
   measuring the difference between simulated and measured data, but it
   often results in the minimization trapped in local minima. One way to
   mitigate this is by selecting another misfit function with better
   convexity properties. Here we propose using the quadratic Wasserstein
   metric (W-2) as a new misfit function in FWI. The optimal map defining
   W-2 can be computed by solving a Monge-Ampere equation. Theorems
   pointing to the advantages of using optimal transport over L-2 norm will

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{132-160}},
Abstract = {{The paper develops and tests theory that explains under what conditions
   the extent of email use is appraised as a stressor. Integrating concepts
   from information acquisition and person-environment fit theories, we
   hypothesize that individuals appraise their extent of email use as
   stressful based on the mismatch between their current and desired
   extents of email use. We define the mismatch as email misfit and the
   match as email fit. We first develop a conceptual framework that
   associates email misfit with the individual's experience of three key
   workplace stressors-work relationships stressor, job control stressor,
   and job conditions stressor. We then develop hypotheses framing the
   relationship between email fit and misfit, and these stressors. We test
   our hypotheses by applying quadratic polynomial regressions and
   surface-response analysis to survey data obtained from 118 working
   individuals. The paper makes three theoretical contributions. First, in
   reporting a theoretical and empirical construction of email fit and
   misfit and their relationship to workplace stressors, it shows that
   email misfit is appraised as stress-creating. That is, both too much
   email and too little, compared to what the individual desires, are
   associated with stressors. Secondly, it shows that IT use (in this case,
   email) is appraised as stressful both when it exceeds (i.e., associated
   with overload) and fails to meet (i.e., associated with underload), the
   user's expectation and preference. Thirdly, this paper suggests the
   person-environment approach as a theoretically novel way to
   conceptualize the cognitive appraisal and judgement associated with
   information underacquisition and overacquisition and shows workplace
   stressors as potentially new effects associated with them.}},

Title = {{THE IMPACT OF IDEOLOGY MISFIT ON OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE COMMUNITIES AND
   COMPANIES}},

Abstract = {{Corporate involvement in open source software (OSS) communities has
   increased substantially in recent years. Often this takes the form of
   company employees devoting their time to contribute code to the efforts
   of projects in these communities. Ideology has traditionally served to
   motivate, coordinate, and guide volunteer contributions to OSS
   communities. As employees represent an increasing proportion of the
   participants in OSS communities, the role of OSS ideology in guiding
   their commitment and code contributions is unknown. In this research, we
   argue that OSS ideology misfit has important implications for companies
   and the OSS communities to which their employees contribute, since their
   engagement in such communities is not necessarily voluntary. We
   conceptualize two different types of misfit: OSS ideology under-fit,
   whereby an employee embraces an OSS ideology more than their coworkers
   or OSS community do, and OSS ideology over-fit, whereby an employee
   perceives that their coworkers or OSS community embrace the OSS ideology
   more strongly than the employee does. To develop a set of hypotheses
   about the implications of these two types of misfit for employee
   commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community, we draw
   on self-determination theory. We test the hypotheses in a field study of
   186 employees who participate in an OSS community. We find that OSS
   ideology under-fit impacts the company and the community in the same
   way: it decreases employee commitment to the company and commitment to
   the OSS community. In contrast, we find that OSS ideology over-fit
   increases commitment to the company but decreases commitment to the OSS
   community. Finally, we find that employees' commitment to their company
   reinforces the impact of their commitment to the OSS community in
   driving ongoing code contributions. This provides a holistic view of OSS
   ideology and its impacts among an increasingly pervasive yet
   understudied type of participant in OSS research. It provides insights
   for companies that are considering assigning their employees to work in
   OSS communities as well as for OSS communities that are partnering with
   these companies.}},

Abstract = {{Coded caching has been shown to significantly reduce traffic load for
   wireless content delivery by creating coded multicasting opportunities.
   However, its order-optimal memory-load tradeoff performance requires the
   file size to go to infinity or grow exponentially with the number of
   users. This letter introduces a new delivery scheme for decentralized
   cache placement in practical settings with finite file packetization.
   The main idea is to characterize the fitness level of each pair of
   mergable packets, then choose the packet pair with the minimum misfit
   value for coded multicasting in a greedy and sequential manner.
   Numerical results show that the proposed scheme attains the lowest
   traffic load among all existing schemes at all values of file size and
   cache size with polynomial complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Graphs are a natural fit for modeling concepts used in solving diverse
   problems in science, commerce, engineering, and governance. Responding
   to the variety of graph data and algorithms, many parallel and
   distributed graph-processing systems exist. However, until now these
   platforms use a static model of deployment: they only run on a
   pre-defined set of machines. This raises many conceptual and pragmatic
   issues, including misfit with the highly dynamic nature of graph
   processing, and could lead to resource waste and high operational costs.
   In contrast, in this work we explore a dynamic, elastic model of
   deployment. To conduct an in-depth elasticity study of distributed graph
   processing, we build a prototype, JoyGraph, which is the first such
   system that implements complex, policy-based, and fine-grained
   elasticity. Using the state-of-the-art LDBC Graphalytics benchmark and
   the SPEC Cloud Group's elasticity metrics, we show the benefits of
   elasticity in graph processing: improved resource utilization, and
   aligned operation-workload dynamicity. Furthermore, we explore the cost
   of elasticity in graph processing. We identify a key drawback: although
   elasticity does not degrade application throughput, graph-processing
   workloads are sensitive to data movement while leasing or releasing
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in information technologies (IT) have powered the merger
   of online and offline retail channels into one single platform. Modern
   consumers frequently switch between online and offline channels when
   they navigate through various stages of the decision journey, motivating
   multichannel sellers to develop omni-channel strategies that optimize
   their overall profit. This study examines consumers' cross-channel
   search behavior of ``pseudo-showrooming,{''} or the consumer behavior of
   inspecting one product at a seller's physical store before buying a
   related but different product at the same seller's online store, and
   investigates how such consumer behavior allows a multichannel seller to
   achieve better coordination between its online and offline arms through
   optimal product placement strategies.
   We develop a stylized model in which a multichannel firm offers a
   product line consisting of two horizontally differentiated products.
   Consumers are uncertain about the true value of either product. A
   consumer's uncertainty regarding a particular product's value is fully
   resolved after inspecting that product in person, and can also be
   partially resolved after inspecting the other related product. By
   selling only one product through the dual channel and the other product
   through the online channel exclusively, the firm induces consumer
   pseudoshow-rooming for the online exclusive product. Our analysis shows
   that this product placement strategy generates a greater profit than
   selling both products through the dual channel, if the fit probability
   of individual products and consumers' cost for returning a misfit
   product are both in the intermediate range. Moreover, we find that over
   a large parameter region, consumers also enjoy a greater total surplus
   under the firm's product placement strategy that induces consumer
   pseudo-showrooming. Furthermore, we find that the firm garners the most
   benefit from inducing consumer pseudo-showrooming by selling the
   higher-quality product or the higher-demand product through the online
   channel exclusively. Collectively, our study offers a compelling
   demand-side justification of the commonly witnessed practice among
   multichannel sellers to offer products online exclusively when offline
   selling is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{To remain competitive, SMEs rely on technologies that automate support
   for their operations. Although an increasing number of SMEs use ERP
   systems, one of the major challenges is the selection of a software that
   fully meets their business needs. ERP systems generally come as
   standardized software packages. They are designed to fit generic rather
   than enterprise-specific requirements. Thus, mutual alignments of
   business and IT are essential to ensure an implementation project's
   success. However, many organizational change efforts involving the
   introduction of new technologies fail due to the work-force's resistance
   towards changes in their workflows, business processes, and technology
   they use. These so-called technochange situations require appropriate
   solutions that are complete and implementable. Thus, changes to business
   and IT must be complementary and organization-enterprise system misfits
   must be minimized. Following the paradigm of design science research,
   this contribution addresses technochange in ERP projects by assessing
   the organization-enterprise system fit during ERP selection. Applying a
   process fit perspective, organizational process models can be compared
   to ERP reference models using measures of business process similarity.
   In an experiment, we illustrate how ERP systems can be distinguished and
   ranked by their process features, positively influencing organizational
   fit and the likelihood of an ERP project's success.}},

   explicitly modeling the device dissimilarity, one can improve

   weighting each training set differently. Second, we use the Gaussian

   reliably estimates the linear fit and device dissimilarity given only a
   few labeled samples from each new device. By accounting for device
   dissimilarities in map fusion and by using the proposed regression
   algorithm, localization performance can be greatly improved given just a

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects are complex and resource
   demanding. Some ERP projects fail due to what is called `misfit' between
   the adopting organization's business requirements and the ERP's
   functionalities. Existing literature has studied how ERP systems match
   to different organizations and have argued that there always exists a
   gap between the business rules embedded in the system, and the practices
   and processes that exist in organizations. Thus, tailoring might be an
   important procedure during ERP implementations, in which the ERP
   customization takes place in order to ensure the compliance with the
   organizations' critical business processes and requirements.
   Via an in-depth case study, this research investigates how the different
   ERP tailoring types defined in literature correspond to different types
   of misfits identified in an ERP implementation project at a large public
   organization. The study results suggest that there is a correlation
   between tailoring types and categories of misfits. In other words,
   different categories of misfits can be decisive for the type of
   customization being used. These categories can be organized into four
   main influences that affect tailoring; strategy, project, system and
   institution. Moreover, internal institutional factors that are linked to
   system acceptance, such as culture and resistance could affect
   tailoring. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY}},
Journal = {{MIS QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has shown that a firm's plural sourcing strategy, which
   determines how much it chooses to make versus how much it chooses to
   buy, requires consideration of the complementarities and constraints
   that affect the differential advantages of making and buying.
   Elaborating on this perspective, we theorize how (mis)fit between a
   firm's plural sourcing strategy of simultaneously making and buying and
   its development of information technology (IT) enabled interfirm and
   intrafirm process integration capabilities influences firm performance
   in deregulated markets. We position our theory development and empirical
   tests in the context of the power-generation segment of the U.S.
   electric utility industry (EUI), an asset-intensive industry that has
   been deregulated to promote the separation of key value chain activities
   (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution) and the development
   of wholesale energy markets. We draw on the transaction cost economics,
   coordination costs, and IT capabilities perspectives to theorize that a
   firm achieves fit (realizing performance benefits) by increasing market
   sourcing intensity (MSI)-or, how much it buys relative to how much it
   makes- and developing IT-enabled interfirm process integration
   capability for external coordination with the market, or misfit
   (realizing performance penalties) by increasing MSI and developing
   IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability for coordinating
   internal production. We collated data from archival sources for 342
   utility firms in the power-generation segment to construct a panel
   dataset for the period 1994-2004 on (1) firms' MSI from wholesale
   electricity markets, (2) firms' IT investment decisions to develop
   interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities, (3) measures
   of firm performance, and (4) several control variables related to
   exogenous shocks (i.e., regulatory change, oil crisis), region of
   operation, and firm-level factors. Our results suggest that fit between
   MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration
   capability improves firm profitability, assessed by return on assets,
   and misfit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled intrafirm
   process integration capability extracts penalties in firm profitability.
   We also find evidence that fit between MSI and the development of
   IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves market
   valuation, assessed by Tobin's Q, and asset turnover, assessed by
   operating revenue/total assets. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for the development of IT capabilities to accompany a firm's
   plural sourcing strategy and the literature on IT business value.}},

Abstract = {{The use of information systems in organisations presents one of the
   early signs of success. Hundreds of studies have generated a wealth of
   knowledge on systems use across a broad range of technologies and
   theoretical approaches. However, new types of technologies and
   organisations continue to pose challenges to systems use. The case of
   open systems that are offered to users on a voluntary basis presents one
   of those challenges for two reasons: 1) the systems are open in the
   sense that they could be configured in many ways depending on users
   finding use cases and possible applications; 2) the system use is
   voluntary and hence there is no organisational push. They bring users'
   choice and active finding of use cases to the centre of their success.
   This study questions why and how users choose to engage (or not to
   engage) with open technology on a voluntary basis and how and why its
   use options and potential unfold? It examines a longitudinal case study
   (1994-2012) on the voluntary use of telemedicine. The findings reveal
   that users' perception of open technology in a voluntary setting is
   formed through a continuous interplay between users' technology mental
   models, professional identity, institutional traditions and arrangements
   and work practices. If perceived to be in contradiction with
   professional identity, institutional traditions and arrangements or work
   practices, users' technology mental models are fixated on the misfit and
   the misfit is thereby reinforced. Hence, users do not try to find use
   cases or think of possible applications. However, institutional
   entrepreneurs could break this self-fulfilling prophecy by influencing
   both the technology mental models of users and the institutional
   arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{The modification of ERP systems and adaptation of business processes is
   widely recognized as complicated and expensive during implementation and
   post implementation. While there is research focusing on the
   classification and impact of different ERP modification strategies,
   research addressing the cost implication of ERP modifications is still
   lacking. In this paper, we look at existing literature to classify ERP
   modification strategies, and then we focus on the issue of evaluating
   the relative cost of different strategies. We gather the opinion of
   experts in ERP implementations about the relative cost of alternative
   strategies using an AHP-based online questionnaire. Based on the results
   of the data collection, we build cost functions to compare the relative
   cost of alternative strategies. Our approach represents a first step in
   quantifying the relative cost of different ERP implementation strategies
   and can be exploited in decision-making problems related to ERP change
   and evolution.}},

Title = {{A Hybrid Load Balancing Scheme for Games in Wireless Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},

Abstract = {{A wireless network consists of a large number of nodes with limited
   resources. The large number of event data will be generated over a
   period of time in a wireless network. Also, faced with high resource
   demand variability and with misfit resource renting policies, the
   current practices is to overprovision for each game tens of owned data.
   In a wireless network, the agent node may become easily overloaded by
   the high demand from the players for updates. So, we propose a hybrid
   load balancing scheme for games in wireless networks which is based on
   allocating load on wireless mobile nodes proportionally to each of the
   agent's capacities. This proposed scheme is a combined dynamic
   provisioning algorithm based on greedy graph and user-oriented load
   balancing scheme for maintaining the performance and stability of
   distributed system in wireless networks. We address the key functions
   for our proposed scheme and simulate the efficiency of our proposed
   scheme using mathematical analyses. We then testify that the proposal
   has best performance compared with previous researches.}},

Abstract = {{We consider new formulations and methods for sparse quantile regression
   in the high-dimensional setting. Quantile regression plays an important
   role in many data mining applications, including outlier-robust
   exploratory analysis in gene selection. In addition, the sparsity
   consideration in quantile regression enables the exploration of the
   entire conditional distribution of the response variable given the
   predictors and therefore yields a more comprehensive view of the
   important predictors. We propose a generalized Orthogonal Matching
   Pursuit algorithm for variable selection, taking the misfit loss to be
   either the traditional quantile loss or a smooth version we call
   quantile Huber, and compare the resulting greedy approaches with convex
   sparsity-regularized formulations. We apply a recently proposed interior
   point methodology to efficiently solve all formulations, provide
   theoretical guarantees of consistent estimation, and demonstrate the
   performance of our approach using empirical studies of simulated and

   that there is a network externality to adopting such systems. Moreover,
   the aforementioned two forces interact with each other as the benefits
   of SCM system will be amplified in the supply chain network as the
   number of system users increases. Likewise, the problems of SCM system

Abstract = {{In classic work, Kuntz et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96,

   Metal binding led to the greatest ligand efficiencies. Here, the
   physical limits of binding are examined across the wide variety of small
   molecules in the Binding MOAD database. The complexes with the greatest
   ligand efficiencies share the trait of being small, charged ligands
   bound in highly charged, well buried binding sites. The limit of ligand
   efficiency is -1.75 kcal/mol.atom for the protein-ligand complexes
   within Binding MOAD and 95\% of the set have efficiencies below a ``soft

   surface area, the hard limit of ligand efficiency is -117
   cal/mol.angstrom(2), which is in surprising agreement with the limit of
   macromolecule protein binding. Close examination of the most efficient
   systems reveals their incredibly high efficiency is dictated by tight

Abstract = {{For non-linear inverse problems, the mathematical structure of the
   mapping from model parameters to data is usually unknown or partly
   unknown. Absence of information about the mathematical structure of this
   function prevents us from presenting an analytical solution, so our
   solution depends on our ability to produce efficient search algorithms.
   Such algorithms may be completely problem-independent (which is the case
   for the so-called `meta-heuristics' or `blind-search' algorithms), or
   they may be designed with the structure of the concrete problem in mind.
   We show that pure meta-heuristics are inefficient for large-scale,
   non-linear inverse problems, and that the `no-free-lunch' theorem holds.
   We discuss typical objections to the relevance of this theorem.
   A consequence of the no-free-lunch theorem is that algorithms adapted to
   the mathematical structure of the problem perform more efficiently than
   pure meta-heuristics. We study problem-adapted inversion algorithms that
   exploit the knowledge of the smoothness of the misfit function of the
   problem. Optimal sampling strategies exist for such problems, but many
   of these problems remain hard.}},

Abstract = {{To compete in a highly dynamic marketplace, firms must frequently adapt
   and align their competitive strategies and information systems. The
   dominant literature on the strategic fit of a firm's information systems
   focuses primarily on high-level measures of the strategic fit of a
   firm's overall IS portfolio and the impact of fit on business
   performance. This paper addresses the need for a more fine-grained
   approach for assessing the specific areas of misfit between a firm's
   competitive strategies and IS capabilities. We describe the design and
   evaluation of a multilevel strategic fit (MSF) measurement model that
   enables researchers and practitioners to measure the strategic fit of a
   firm's information systems at both an overall and a detailed level. The
   steps in the model include identifying the relevant IS capabilities
   according to the type of system; measuring the current level of support
   for each capability using a capabilities instrument; identifying the
   ideal level of support for each capability using an adaptation of Conant
   et al.'s (1990) instrument to assess strategic archetype; and comparing
   the ideal and realized level of support for each capability. Evidence
   from a multiple case study analysis indicates that the fine-grained
   assessment of strategic fit can strengthen the validity, utility, and
   ease of corroboration of the strategic fit measurement outputs. The
   paper also demonstrates how an iterative design science research
   approach, with its emphasis on evaluating the utility of prototype
   artifacts, is well suited to developing field-tested and theoretically
   grounded measurement models and instruments that are accessible to
   practitioners. This focus on practical utility in turn provides
   researchers with results that can be more readily corroborated, thus
   improving the quality and usefulness of the research findings.}},

   Findings - Participants were frequently overwhelmed by e-mail alerts,
   and a key requirement is to support efficient interaction. Several
   misfits, which act as barriers to efficient reviewing and follow-on
   activities, are demonstrated. These relate to a lack of representation
   of key user-concepts at the interface and/or within the system,
   including alert items and their properties, source documents,
   ``back-story{''}, primary sources, content categorisations and user
   collections.
   Research limitations/implications - Given these misfits, a set of
   requirements is derived to improve the efficiency with which users can
   achieve key outcomes with current-awareness information as these occur
   within a professional work environment.
   Originality/value - The findings will be of interest to
   current-awareness providers. The approach is relevant to information
   interaction researchers interested in deriving design requirements from
   naturalistic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Packaged software applications such as enterprise systems are designed
   to support generic rather than specific requirements, and hence are
   likely to be an imperfect fit in any particular instance. Using critical
   realism as our philosophical perspective, we conducted a three-year
   qualitative study of misfits that arose from an enterprise system (ES)
   implementation. A detailed analysis of the observed misfits resulted in
   a richer understanding of the concept of fit and of the ES artifact
   itself Specifically, we found six misfit domains (functionality, data,
   usability, role, control and organizational culture) and within each,
   two types of misfit (deficiencies and impositions). These misfit types
   correspond to two newly defined types of fit: fit as coverage and fit as
   enablement. Our analysis of fit also revealed a new conceptualization of
   the ES artifact, with implications for IT artifacts in general.}},

   and the nature of the cooperation with the user organization. The

Abstract = {{UKM2 is an intelligence test developed to screen gifted students in
   Malaysia. This study aims at identifying the reliability and validity of
   the UKM2 using the item analysis method. 497 undergraduate students
   randomly selected from a Malaysian local university, were chosen as
   respondents. The test was administered via on-line. The Items Response
   Theory (IRT) is used with the application of Rasch model of measurement
   for the analysis procedure. The scoring of UKM2 are dichotomus and
   partial credit models based. The result of study shows that all the
   subtests have the reliability values of Cronbach's alpha>0.80
   (0.86-0.99) and separation indexes>2 (2.51-11.94) with the number of
   stratas 3-16. All the subtests are unidimensionals except for Block
   Design and Comprehension subtests. The study confirms that UKM2 is a
   multidimensional test with four correlated dimensions which are Verbal
   Comprehension Index (VCI), Working Memory Index (WMI), Perceptual
   Reasoning Index (PRI) and Processing Speed Index (PSI). Research shows
   that 221 are fit items (MNSQ 0.5-1.5), 69 items are overfit and 80 items
   are misfits, using the Infit and Outfit statistics. Most of the misfit
   items are from the Symbol Search subtests, while most of the overfit
   items are from Arithmetic, Letter-Number Sequencing and Picture
   Completion subtests. The study suggests for the elimination of the
   overfit items and for the revision or removal of the misfit items in the

Abstract = {{We use a game-theoretic model to examine how information personalization
   by firms interacts with different dimensions of product differentiation
   (namely, horizontal and vertical differentiation). We consider the
   possibility that consumers attach different importance to various types
   of product differentiation, and report the equilibrium in terms of the
   ``quality-fit{''} ratio, which measures the relative strength of
   preference for quality compared to preference for product fit and is a
   function of the cost of quality and the cost of product misfit. We also
   consider how different market structures (whether firms are similar or
   differentiated on the horizontal dimension ex ante) lead to different
   equilibriums when firms adopt personalization. We show that
   personalization by one firm leads to higher profits for both firms if
   product quality and misfit costs are high and the firms offer similar
   products ex ante. On the other hand, if firms offer differentiated
   products, personalization is profitable only if the effectiveness of the
   personalization technology is high or if both product quality and misfit
   costs are low. We also highlight conditions under which investments in
   personalization and product quality can be complements or Substitutes to
   each other. Finally, we show that a firm can respond to a competitor's
   personalization by either increasing (aggressive response) or decreasing
   (defensive response) investments in its own quality. Our results provide
   insights to managers on when to invest in personalization technologies
   and how to adjust their investments in product quality after the firm
   (or its competitor) adopts personalization.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional clustering algorithms often suffer from model misfit problem
   when the distribution of real data does not fit the model assumptions.
   To address this problem, we propose a novel clustering framework based
   on adaptive space mapping and rescaling, referred as M-R framework. The
   basic idea of our approach is to adjust the data representation to make
   the data distribution fit the model assumptions better. Specifically,
   documents are first mapped into a low dimensional space with respect to
   the cluster centers so that the distribution statistics of each cluster
   could be analyzed on the corresponding dimension. With the statistics
   obtained in hand, a rescaling operation is then applied to regularize
   the data distribution based on the model assumptions. These two steps
   are conducted iteratively along with the clustering algorithm to
   constantly improve the clustering performance. In our work, we apply the
   M-R framework on the most widely used clustering algorithm, i.e.
   k-means, as an example. Experiments on well known datasets show that our
   M-R framework can obtain comparable performance with state-of-the-art
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) three-dimensional

   parallelism and optimized finite-difference meshing. We report on an
   imaging experiment utilizing 32,768 tasks (and processors) on the IBM
   Blue Gene/L (TM) (BG/L) supercomputer at the IBM T. J. Watson Research
   Center. Over a 24-hour period, we were able to image a large-scale
   marine CSEM field dataset that previously required more than 4 months of
   computing time on distributed clusters utilizing 1,024 tasks on an
   InfiniBand((R)) fabric. The total initial data-fitting errors (i.e.,
   ``misfits{''}) could be decreased by 67\% within 72 completed inversion
   iterations, indicating the existence Of an electrically resistive region
   in the southern survey area below a depth of 1,500 m underneath the
   seafloor. The major part of the residual misfit stems from
   transmitter-parallel receiver components that have an offset from the
   transmitter sail line (broadside configuration). Modeling confirms that
   improved broadside data fits can be achieved by considering anisotropic
   electrical conductivities. While delivering a satisfactory gross-scale
   image for the depths of interest, the experiment provides important
   evidence,for the necessity of discriminating between horizontal and
   vertical conductivities for maximally consistent 3D CSEM inversions.}},

Abstract = {{There are many benefits of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems,
   but their implementation is both complicated and difficult because the
   product spans functional silos and involves many internal and external

   different ERP systems can embody distinct social arrangements when
   developed in different cultural contexts. Such social arrangements are
   difficult to change due the closure effect of technology stabilization.
   This leads to various misfit problems, both during and after ERP
   implementation, causing adverse effects on delivered ERP quality. With a
   survey of 85 ERP implementation cases in Taiwan, this study derives and
   empirically tests the main as well as the interaction effects of the
   country of origin of the ERP package, consultant quality, top management
   support, and user support of the ERP system quality as perceived by the

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Software developers face a constant barrage of innovations designed to
   improve the development environment. Yet stress/strain among software
   developers has been steadily increasing and is at an all-time high,
   while their productivity is often questioned. Why, if these innovations
   are meant to improve the environment, are developers more stressed and
   less productive than they should be? Using a combination of cognitive
   style and person-environment fit theories as the theoretical lens, this
   study examines one potential source of stress/strain and productivity
   impediment among software developers. Specifically, this paper examines
   the fit between the preferred cognitive style of a software developer
   and his or her perception of the cognitive style required by the job
   environment, and the effect of that fit on stress/strain and
   performance. Data collected from a field study of 123 (object-oriented)
   software developers suggest that performance decreases and stress
   increases as this gap between cognitive styles becomes wider. Using
   surface response methodology, the precise fit relationship is modeled.
   The interaction of the developer and the environment provides
   explanatory power above and beyond either of the factors separately,
   suggesting that studies examining strain and performance of developers
   should explicitly consider and measure the cognitive style fit between
   the software developer and the software development environment. In
   practice, managers can use the results to help recognize misfit, its
   consequences, and the appropriate interventions (such as training or
   person/task matching).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-20}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Using IT in ways that can trigger major organizational changes creates
   high-risk, potentially high-reward, situations that I call technochange
   (for technology-driven organizational change). Technochange differs from
   typical IT projects and from typical organizational change programs and
   therefore requires a different approach. One major risk in
   technochange-that people will not use information technology and related
   work practices-is not thoroughly addressed by the discipline of IT
   project management, which focuses on project cost, project schedule, and
   solution functionality. Organizational change management approaches are
   also generally not effective on their own, because they take as a given
   the IT ``solutions{''} developed by a technical team. Consequently, the
   potential for the IT ``solution{''} to be misaligned with important
   organizational characteristics, such as culture or incentives, is great.
   Merely combining IT project management and organizational change
   management approaches does not produce the best results, for two
   reasons. First, the additive approach does not effectively address the
   many failure-threatening problems that can arise over the lengthy
   sequential process of the typical technochange lifecycle. Second, the
   additive approach is not structured to produce the characteristics of a
   good technochange solution: a complete intervention consisting of IT and
   complementary organizational changes, an implementable solution with
   minimal misfits with the existing organization, and an organization
   primed to appropriate the potential benefits of the technochange
   solution. With hard work and care, the combined IT project management
   plus organizational change approach can be made to work. However, an
   iterative, incremental approach to implementing technochange can be a
   better strategy in many situations. The essential characteristic of the
   technochange prototyping approach is that each phase involves both new
   IT functionality and related organizational changes, such as redesigned
   business processes, new performance metrics, and training.}},

Abstract = {{Before software project managers can enhance productivity and
   satisfaction of the software project team member, the effect of task
   characteristics, goal orientations, and coordination strategies on
   design and coding-task outcomes must be understood. A research model,
   which suggests that task interdependence, goal conflict, and
   coordination strategies significantly affect productivity and
   satisfaction associated with software design and coding activities, is
   presented. Issues such as contingency/design misfit, conflicting
   contingencies, and the extent of deviation to theoretically prescribed
   coordination mechanisms applied to contingencies are used to make
   predictions on productivity and process satisfaction. A 2x2x2 factorial
   experiment was utilized. Overall, projects characterized by low task
   interdependence exhibited greater productivity than projects with high
   task interdependence. Also, in general, organic coordination was more
   productive than mechanistic coordination. There was also a significant
   interaction between task interdependence and coordination strategy. Low
   goal conflict and organic coordination each lead to greater process
   satisfaction. Productivity results for the goal conflict manipulation
   was opposite to the hypothesized direction. Unconflicted contingencies
   addressed with consistent coordination and partially conflicted
   contingencies, regardless of the coordination used, exhibited
   significant gains in productivity. In comparison, unconflicted
   contingencies with inconsistent coordination and conflicted
   contingencies, regardless of the coordination applied, resulted in lower
   productivity. This suggests that there are instances where multiple
   contingencies, which warrant the use of different coordination
   strategies, can be adequately addressed with a specific coordination
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Many computer vision systems depend on reliable detection of 3-D
   boundaries and regions in order to proceed In the presence of outliers,
   missing data, and orientation discontinuities due to occlusion, it is
   difficult to detect boundaries and interpolate data without
   over-smoothing important feature curves. In this paper, we address these
   problems by incorporating first order tensor information into the tensor
   voting formalism, which is second-order based To propagate an adaptive
   smoothness constraint at a preferred orientation non-iteratively, we
   vote for a first order tensor (or vector) to capture polarity and
   orientation information. To integrate first and second order tensors, we
   propose an algorithm for inferring the proper scale based on the
   continuity constraint, and preserving the finest details. Given a noisy
   3-D point set, the new and improved formalism can better localize
   boundary curves and orientation discontinuities. Unlike many approaches
   that over-smooth features, or delay the handling of boundaries and
   discontinuities until model misfit occurs, the interaction of smooth
   features, boundaries, discontinuities, outliers are encoded at the
   representation level. We present results from a variety of datasets to
   show the efficacy of the improved formalism.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to study the topography of
   strained SiGe films and multilayer Si/SiGe heterostructures. Strain
   relaxation processes are found to determine the formation of surface
   morphology, with distinct morphological features arising from both
   misfit dislocation formation and three-dimensional growth of coherent
   islands and pits on the surface. Studies of these features for various
   values of strain (Ge content) and growth temperature reveal the
   underlying physical processes determining the strain relaxation. Fourier
   analysis of AFM images is performed to obtain quantitative roughness
   information and to separate roughness components of different physical
   origin.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper two approaches to design are compared, namely those
   proposed by Langefors and Alexander.  The Langeforsian approach aims to
   introduce effective methods for information system design and to utilise
   the potential of computers and information technology in controlling
   organisations and improving their performance.  The aim of Alexander's
   approach is to improve architectural design by bridging the gap between
   designer and users.  Both approaches have given important contributions
   to design in their fields.  In both approaches graphs and matrices are
   important tools.  Also, procedures for finding subsystems and components
   are put forward in both approaches, and the process of design is
   subdivided.  The two approaches are different with regard to
   requirements definitions, in the Langeforsian approach goals are
   crucial, while misfits are focussed in Alexander's approach.  The
   notions of goals and misfits are examined.  Finally, systems-fit
   approaches to information system design are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A system M tangent to a plant P at the nominal equilibrium is a nicely
   nonlinear model of P if it is rigorously linearizable by output
   feedback. The general structure of a nicely nonlinear modelling problem
   can be outlined as follows. Given: i) a class of parametrized nonlinear
   models, and a feasible parameter set, such that any feasible model is
   nicely nonlinear, ii) a family of significant operating conditions
   (input-output pairs) of P, minimize, over the feasible parameter set, a
   nonnegative misfit function (relative to the considered family of
   operating conditions) between the nicely nonlinear model and the plant
   The purpose of the present paper is to present an algorithm for the
   semi-infinite nonlinear programming problem resulting from a particular
   instance of the general setting above.}},
