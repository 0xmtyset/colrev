Check the changes
==================================

Using a git `client of your choice <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>`_, you can inspect the report created for each commit:

CoLRev also ensures that the git-diffs are readable so you can check all changes:

Instructions on how to correct and trace errors are available in the guidelines for the respective step.
