Roadmap
==================================

**Development status**: Currently recommend for users with technical experience. Once CoLRev has matured, UIs should make it accessible to a broader user base. CoLRev is the result of intense prototyping, research and development. We use it for our own projects and believe it is ready to be released - after all, git ensures that your work is never lost.

The goal is to release new versions on a regular basis, approximately every 2 months.

Expected release: 0.5.0 (June 2022)
