Abstract = {{The rise of the digital labour market in recent years has stimulated the
   growth of the digital nomad community. To cater to this specific
   work-leisure segment, many co-living spaces are actively marketing their
   products to be the perfect accommodation solution to help overcome the
   isolation that urbanity and digital nomadism bring along. However,
   little research has been done to explore these new solutions of living
   circumstances and whether it enhances digital nomads' lifestyle. This
   study is particularly interested in exploring the role of co-living
   spaces in digital nomads' overall well-being. Through a grounded theory
   approach, 12 interviews with digital nomads living in co-living spaces
   are conducted and generated new insights. In doing so, the paper
   elaborates on the specific elements of co-living spaces that influence
   digital nomads' experiences and subsequently explains how the elements
   of digital nomads' overall well-being links to the neo-tribe theory. In
   the end, based on the neo-tribe characteristics exhibited by digital
   nomads, practitioners are given recommendations on how to improve the
   design and developments of co-living spaces to facilitate digital
   nomads' well-being.}},

Abstract = {{This research focuses upon employment in the new economy, exploring
   labour protection and social protection in the digital age in China.
   Through an empirical survey conducted in three Chinese cities, social
   insurance and the labour rights of employees in the digital economic
   sector, such as gig employment, e-commerce, and various other forms of
   online employment, have been examined in-depth. This study reveals new
   regulatory loopholes in the digital labour market, which have
   substantially eroded the basis of social policy arrangements in China,
   ``softening{''} participation in social insurance branches and
   compliance with labour regulations remarkably. Drawing upon the
   theoretical concepts of Polanyi on embeddedness and disembeddedness, we
   argue that the digital employment sector in China has been increasingly
   disembedded from social institutions and social control. The new
   configuration in the digital field of social policy requires novel
   conceptual models and institutional settings to cope with increasing
   social risks in virtual spaces.}},

Title = {{Climate change, Agrarian distress, and the role of digital labour
   markets: evidence from Bengaluru, Karnataka}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we explore the use of the digital labour market set up
   by mobility platforms in Bengaluru, Karnataka, as a mechanism to cope
   with climate change-induced livelihood transition. Climatic hot spots
   within regions like the southern Indian state of Karnataka have caused a
   large volume of livelihood transition along the rural-urban continuum
   (Revi in Environ Urban 20(1):207-229, 2008. 10.1177/0956247808089157).
   Bengaluru is Karnataka's primate city, thus absorbing agrarians pushed
   out of unprofitable agriculture into its ever-growing informal service
   sector (Singh et al. in Clim Risk Manag 21(June):52-68, 2018.
   10.1016/j.crm.2018.06.001). Climate-induced migration into urban centres
   creates intersecting forms of differential vulnerability. This
   vulnerability is structured by social discrimination embedded in
   informal economies, performed through respect, dignity, and humiliation
   in work encounters in relational economies (Simone in Public Cult
   16(3):407-429, 2004). Mobility platforms like Uber and Ola cabs have
   added to work opportunities within Bengaluru's service sector by
   creating an alternative work opportunitythe digital labour market for
   taxi driving. The digital labour market set up by the mobility platforms
   offers migrants an alternative labour market to plug into without
   reliance on relational economies or incurring social debt. We find that
   the digital labour ecosystem attracts climate change-impacted migrants
   by offsetting access to work opportunities' in three key ways: (a)
   overcoming relational voids, (b) substituting network costs and
   circumventing social debts, (c) supplementing precarious agricultural
   work. This article uses evidence from qualitative data collected from
   in-depth semi-structured interviews with 113 Uber and Ola cab drivers in
   Bengaluru between 2015 and 2018 to explore the presence of the digital
   labour market as short-term adaptive strategy to create resilience
   against climate change-induced livelihood transitions into complex urban
   informal labour markets.}},

Abstract = {{The research is conducted to identify accurate ways to increase the
   levels of digital competences for employability, up-skilling, aligned
   with the needs of and opportunities offered by the digital labour
   market. Moreover, we aim to enhance new, innovative and more effective
   regional approaches to equipping youth and adults with the digital
   skills that are increasingly needed in the digital economy. Ultimately,
   we assess the impact of digital transformation on the EU labour markets,
   extrapolating key digital credentials affecting the labour market
   outcomes. The research endeavour comprises a mix of methods adopted to
   pour main goal of the paper. Preliminary results reveal that a highly
   skilled workforce is mostly supporting digitalization, while education,
   research-development \& innovation have a significant positive impact on
   economic growth and wellfare (measured through GDP per capita). At the
   same time, the results entail the keen need to redesign tailored labour
   market policies that respond to the digital transformation challenges in
   line with the European Pillar of Social Rights in order to embrace the
   future of work and new business models (such as collaborative
   co-creation \& co-working platforms) enabled by the modern digital
   technologies. The large volume of information and knowledge, as well as
   their access easiness and emerging possibilities to process and use them
   by active involvement within social and professional networks lead to
   significant changes in core competences. Amplified value added of the
   set of core competences \& skills induce an increase in the number,
   quality, structure and complexity of inventions and innovations that are
   further applied at both the regional and/or national levels.}},

Abstract = {{At the outset authors of this article investigate the influence of ICT
   on archival practice. All archival processes are affected by latest
   developments in ICT. DMS and eSignature requirements and legislation
   (like MoReq and eIDAS) influenced record management practice. PAIS, OAIS
   and storage solutions have their impact on the archival management.
   Special audio and video format solutions influenced specialised
   archives. Graph databases as a more agile tool for organising
   information and the upcoming Records in Contexts (RiC) standard are
   influencing archival description. New preservation methods have emerged
   - Chain of Preservation model (COP) and the upcoming
   Preservation-as-a-Service for Trust (PaasT) model. PaasT is the result
   of growing cloud services. Semantic web influenced retrieval and usage
   of materials in all heritage institutions. The authors proceed to
   discuss how the elaborated changes should reflect the archival science
   academic curricula. They investigate what are new archival science core
   competences that should be taught to students and archival professionals
   by university teachers today, how should universities prepare their
   students of archival science for contemporary (digital) labour market
   etc. The authors offer a clear position what archival competencies,
   arising from the influence of ICT and cloud environment, should be built
   upon in the contemporary archival science curricula.}},
