Forms of reviews
------------------------------------

Literature reviews come in different forms and types. While the next section provides information on standalone literature reviews, CoLRev can also support informal reviews and the development of *related work* sections.
To streamline the process in these cases, the following convenience functions can be used to skip selected steps:

.. code:: bash

	colrev prescreen --include_all
	colrev screen --include_all

Types of literature reviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is a broad consensus across disciplines concerning the differences between types of reviews (see [PareTrudelJanaaEtAl2015]_, [SchryenWagnerBenlianEtAl2020]_, [WagnerPresterRocheEtAl2021]_, [GrantBooth2009]_, [TranfieldDenyerSmart2003]_)

Local review environments
------------------------------------

- Elements (include a figure and explanation):
    - paper_feed/local_paper_index (update & distribute)
    - local topic repositories (e.g., zettalkasten) (often private)
    - paper projects (often shared)
- Best practices for collaboration and sharing setups with students/colleagues
