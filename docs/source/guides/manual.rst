==================================

This is the manual for CoLRev. It explains how to use the functionality of CoLRev to conduct a literature review, covering the installation, the user workflow, the processing operations, and collaboration.
It does not explain the design and architecture of CoLRev, which are covered in the `technical documentation <../technical_documentation/colrev>`_ and the `API reference <../technical_documentation/api>`_.
Our goal is to provide a manual that is self-contained. Yet, it can help to be familiar with the basics of git - for example by catching up with one of the interactive and free tutorials available online (`tutorial <https://learngitbranching.js.org/>`_).

The manual is available under the `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/>`_ and endorses the `Code of Conduct <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/>`_ for contributions.


TBD: should the collaboration/curation come after the workflow/operations?
