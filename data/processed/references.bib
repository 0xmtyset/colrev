DMS and eSignature requirements and legislation (like MoReq and eIDAS) influenced record management practice. PAIS, OAIS and storage solutions have their impact on the archival management. Special audio and video format solutions influenced specialised archives. Graph databases as a more agile tool for organising information and the upcoming Records in Contexts (RiC) standard are influencing archival description. New preservation methods have emerged - Chain of Preservation model (COP) and the upcoming Preservation-as-a-Service for Trust (PaasT) model. PaasT is the result of growing cloud services. Semantic web influenced retrieval and usage of materials in all heritage institutions. The authors proceed to discuss how the elaborated changes should reflect the archival science academic curricula. They investigate what are new archival science core competences that should be taught to students and archival professionals by university teachers today, how should universities prepare their students of archival science for contemporary (digital) labour market etc. The authors offer a clear position what archival competencies, arising from the influence of ICT and cloud environment, should be built upon in the contemporary archival science curricula.},

    abstract = {The research is conducted to identify accurate ways to increase the levels of digital competences for employability, up-skilling, aligned with the needs of and opportunities offered by the digital labour market. Moreover, we aim to enhance new, innovative and more effective regional approaches to equipping youth and adults with the digital skills that are increasingly needed in the digital economy. Ultimately, we assess the impact of digital transformation on the EU labour markets, extrapolating key digital credentials affecting the labour market outcomes. The research endeavour comprises a mix of methods adopted to pour main goal of the paper. Preliminary results reveal that a highly skilled workforce is mostly supporting digitalization, while education, research-development & innovation have a significant positive impact on economic growth and wellfare (measured through GDP per capita). At the same time, the results entail the keen need to redesign tailored labour market policies that respond to the digital transformation challenges in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights in order to embrace the future of work and new business models (such as collaborative co-creation & co-working platforms) enabled by the modern digital technologies. The large volume of information and knowledge, as well as their access easiness and emerging possibilities to process and use them by active involvement within social and professional networks lead to significant changes in core competences. Amplified value added of the set of core competences & skills induce an increase in the number, quality, structure and complexity of inventions and innovations that are further applied at both the regional and/or national levels.},

@article{Surie2019,
    abstract = {In this article, we explore the use of the digital labour market set up by mobility platforms in Bengaluru, Karnataka, as a mechanism to cope with climate change-induced livelihood transition. Climatic hot spots within regions like the southern Indian state of Karnataka have caused a large volume of livelihood transition along the rural-urban continuum (Revi in Environ Urban 20(1):207-229, 2008. 10.1177/0956247808089157). Bengaluru is Karnataka's primate city, thus absorbing agrarians pushed out of unprofitable agriculture into its ever-growing informal service sector (Singh et al. in Clim Risk Manag 21(June):52-68, 2018. 10.1016/j.crm.2018.06.001). Climate-induced migration into urban centres creates intersecting forms of differential vulnerability. This vulnerability is structured by social discrimination embedded in informal economies, performed through respect, dignity, and humiliation in work encounters in relational economies (Simone in Public Cult 16(3):407-429, 2004). Mobility platforms like Uber and Ola cabs have added to work opportunities within Bengaluru's service sector by creating an alternative work opportunitythe digital labour market for taxi driving. The digital labour market set up by the mobility platforms offers migrants an alternative labour market to plug into without reliance on relational economies or incurring social debt. We find that the digital labour ecosystem attracts climate change-impacted migrants by offsetting access to work opportunities' in three key ways: (a) overcoming relational voids, (b) substituting network costs and circumventing social debts, (c) supplementing precarious agricultural work. This article uses evidence from qualitative data collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews with 113 Uber and Ola cab drivers in Bengaluru between 2015 and 2018 to explore the presence of the digital labour market as short-term adaptive strategy to create resilience against climate change-induced livelihood transitions into complex urban informal labour markets.},
