   abstract                      = {It is now easy to track one's sleep through consumer wearable devices like Fitbit from the comfort of one's home. However, compared to clinical measures, the data generated by such consumer devices is limited in its accuracy. The aim of this paper is to explore how users perceive accuracy issues, possible measurement errors and what can be done to address these issues. Through an interview study with 14 Fitbit users we identified three main sources of errors: (1) lack of definition of sleep metrics, (2) limitations in underlying data collection and processing mechanisms, and (3) lack of rigor in tracking approach. This paper proposes countermeasures to address these issues, both from the aspect of technological advancement and through engaging end-users more closely with their data.},

   abstract                      = {In large part due to the highly prescribed nature of the typical school day for children, efforts to design new interactions with technology have often focused on less-structured after-school clubs and other out-of-school environments. We argue that while the school day imposes serious restrictions, school routines can and should be opportunistically leveraged by designers and by youth. Specifically, wearable activity tracking devices open some new avenues for opportunistic collection of and reflection on data from the school day. To demonstrate this, we present two cases from an elementary statistics classroom unit we designed that intentionally integrated wearable activity trackers and child-created data visualizations. The first case involves a group of students comparing favored recess activities to determine which was more physically demanding. The second case is of a student who took advantage of her knowledge of teachers' school day routines to test the reliability of a Fitbit activity tracker against a commercial mobile app.},

   abstract                      = {Wearable consumer physical activity tracking devices (such as Fitbit®) which generate logs of step count data for users offer a simple and relatively inexpensive way to monitor ambulatory behaviour. However, for researchers, the time granularity with which incremental step count data can typically be obtained using these devices, limits their usefulness particularly for short duration events. This prevents wider use of consumer wearables for non-fitness related purposes, such as using step counts to describe specific activities of daily living. This paper describes a method to overcome this limitation by classifying movements based on patterns in the data. We propose a simple model for analysing adjacent step count data values to achieve this using pilot data on physical activity in an office setting.},

In particular, previous works have indicated that the associated fitness apps may contact unexpected Internet destinations. In this work we identify the third-party connections of the official mobile Fitbit application and its partners, and study whether they can be blocked without hindering the essential functionality of the devices. We show that disabling traffic to the domains contained in well-maintained blocklists does not prevent Fitbit trackers from correctly reporting activity data, including steps, workouts, duration and quality of sleep, etc. Moreover, we demonstrate that Fitbit activity data are correctly synchronized for 6 partner apps of Fitbit when utilizing the above blocking rules. Our results suggest that more than of the third parties for the Fitbit-associated apps are contained in credible domain-based blocklists. Furthermore, we find all studied app to contact between 1 and 20 non-required third parties. Finally, over of the blocked destinations are identified by the default installation of uBlock Origin – universally used content filter (adblocker). Unlike previous works on blocking unnecessary IoT communications, our methodology can be easily utilized by end-users.},

Participants were interviewed to assess expectations for this type of technology. Our work contributes an understanding of users' various motivations for tracking brain activity data within a personal informatics system.

Compliance is particularly challenging for many patients but failing to comply can lead to life-threatening consequences. There is some evidence that behaviour change programs based on education are effective, however a program known as Flex that is based on encouraging patients to be more adaptable and adhere less rigidly to a range of habits of daily living has not been evaluated. A core feature of the Flex program is the generation of text messages to remind patients to perform previously agreed habit changes (known as Do's) based on the analysis of Fitbit data. This study aims to apply a constructivist, qualitative methodology with a group of chronic kidney disease patients to assess the extent to which the Flex program has a positive impact on self-efficacy and ultimately on fluid management.},

Recent research focused primarily on the information provided by such devices, i.e., whether the information is accurate and meaningful to people. However, little is known about how people judge the credibility of such information, and how the functionality and the design may influence such judgements. Hence, the aim of this research was to examine how consumers assess the credibility of sleep-tracking devices. We conducted a qualitative study with 22 participants who tracked their sleep for 3 nights with three different devices: Fitbit Charge 2, Neuroon EEG, and SleepScope, a medical sleep monitor. Based on semi-structured interviews, we found that people assess the credibility of sleep-tracking devices based not only on the credibility of sleep data per se, but also on device functionality, interface design and physical appearance. People found it difficult to judge credibility, because of the complexities of sleep stages and micro-arousals (sleep fallacy) and the black boxed nature of devices (black box fallacy), and also because of the misalignment between objective sleep measures and subjective sleep quality. We discuss the significance of design and functionality on the credibility of personal health technologies and highlight design challenges and opportunities to enhance their credibility.},

   abstract                      = {Chickens are the most important poultry species in the world. Globally, industrial-scale production systems account for most of the poultry meat and eggs produced. The welfare of these birds matters for both ethical and economic reasons. From an ethical perspective, poultry have a sufficient degree of awareness to suffer pain if their health is poor, or deprivation if poorly housed. From an economic viewpoint, consumers increasingly value poultry welfare, so better market access can be obtained by producers who demonstrate concern for their flocks. Recent advances in sensor technology has allowed the opportunity to record behavioral patterns in chickens, and several research groups have shown that such data can be exploited to enhance chicken welfare. However, classifying chicken behaviors poses several unique challenges which are not observed in the UCR archive or other classic benchmark collections. In particular, some behaviors are manifested in the shape of the subsequences, whereas others only in more abstract features. Most algorithms only work well for one such modality. In addition, our data of interest has classes that greatly differ in duration, and are only weakly labeled, again defying the assumptions of the classic benchmark datasets. In this work, we propose a general-purpose framework to robustly learn and classify from datasets exhibiting these issues. While our experience is with fowl, the lessons we have learned may be more generally applicable to real-world datasets in other domains including manufacturing and human health.},

Our study includes both the analysis of data taken from an exercise-based experiment and a review of the security risks associated with current protocols used to access Fitbit device data and participant information. In addition to discussion of the FitBit's accelerometer and pulse data as compared to clinical grade devices, we gathered and analyzed subjective participant data on usability and perception of privacy and security using both quantitative and subjective methods. Results showed that FitBit accuracy was not equivalent to medical grade devices, that a majority of risk comes from potentially fraudulent third party applications, and that users are typically justified in their concerns.},

Second, with five parents and specialists at the same school, we conducted interviews to understand their expectations from and current usage of technology. Previous work defines a culture-based framework for assistive technology design with three dimensions: lifestyle, socio-technical infrastructure, and monetary and informational resources. To this framework we propose a fourth dimension of socio-technical aspirations. We discuss the implications of the proposed fourth dimension to the existing framework.},

   abstract                      = {In the past few years, a wide variety of highly capable and inexpensive wearable health sensors have emerged. One of the interesting aspects of such sensors is the capability for researchers to longitudinally and automatically quantify important health behaviors, such as physical activity and sleep, with little intervention required by the participant. While the accuracy of these devices has been evaluated in laboratory settings, there exists little public data with respect to user compliance and the consistency of the resulting measurements at a large scale. The focus of this paper is to share our experience in distributing five hundred Fitbit Charge HR devices across a group of college freshmen and to introduce the resulting dataset from our study, the NetHealth Study. We find that when users are compliant, they tend to be exceptionally so, having an average compliance of 86%. User non-compliance does play a role, however, reducing the overall average compliance rate to 67%. We discuss various reasons for non-compliance and also briefly highlight preliminary monitored characteristics of physical activity and sleep in our student population.},

We recruited 74 subjects to wear Fitbits -- a personal activity monitoring device that tracked the number of steps taken in a day -- and compared step totals in three experimental conditions: a control, a social interaction experience, and a social game we developed called StepCity. We found that for newer Fitbit users, the game led to users taking more steps than they did in a control condition. In this poster, we present the details of our system and the results of a controlled experiment.},

Recently, several low-cost devices have become available to consumers. In this paper, we perform an evaluation on the most popular devices available on the market (in particular Fitbit and Nike+) and report our findings in terms of accuracy, type of data provided, available APIs, and user experience.

People believe that activity tracking systems, such as the Fitbit, may aid them in meeting recommended levels of physical activity. Similar systems have been the subject of previous research, but many of these studies were conducted over a short-term and some results may be attributable to reactivity or novelty effects. We ran a longitudinal mixed-methods effectiveness study using the Fitbit Zip activity tracker with 50 participants. In this paper we present two main challenges experienced during this study: the unreliability of the device and a lack of engagement by some of the participants. The issues we experienced can help inform the design of future studies.},

   abstract                      = {Fitbit fitness trackers record sensitive personal information, including daily step counts, heart rate profiles, and locations visited. By design, these devices gather and upload activity data to a cloud service, which provides aggregate statistics to mobile app users. The same principles govern numerous other Internet-of-Things (IoT) services that target different applications. As a market leader, Fitbit has developed perhaps the most secure wearables architecture that guards communication with end-to-end encryption. In this article, we analyze the complete Fitbit ecosystem and, despite the brand's continuous efforts to harden its products, we demonstrate a series of vulnerabilities with potentially severe implications to user privacy and device security. We employ a range of techniques, such as protocol analysis, software decompiling, and both static and dynamic embedded code analysis, to reverse engineer previously undocumented communication semantics, the official smartphone app, and the tracker firmware. Through this interplay and in-depth analysis, we reveal how attackers can exploit the Fitbit protocol to extract private information from victims without leaving a trace, and wirelessly flash malware without user consent. We demonstrate that users can tamper with both the app and firmware to selfishly manipulate records or circumvent Fitbit's walled garden business model, making the case for an independent, user-controlled, and more secure ecosystem. Finally, based on the insights gained, we make specific design recommendations that can not only mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, but are also broadly applicable to securing future wearable system architectures.},

   abstract                      = {The ubiquity of wearable fitness trackers offers extensive opportunities for research on personal health. However, barriers specific to these trackers such as device abandonment and non-adherence often lead to substantial losses in data. As such, further research into adherence behaviors may derive the insights necessary to address these challenges and lead to more effective long-term studies. This paper serves to explore this approach: investigating the adherence behaviors of 617 college students belonging to a three-year observational study in which participants were monitored via Fitbit Charge HRs. Using this data, our objective was to assess the association between early adherence behaviors and device abandonment/long-term adherence. Adherence behavior from as early as participants' first 10 days in the study correlated with device abandonment and adherence over the next three years. Participants with unsatisfactory adherence in their first 30 days were twice as likely to abandon their devices and were, on average, 11% less adherent each month. The findings in this paper identify the stability of adherence behaviors, feasibility of their early detection and motivate the need to address non-adherent study participants early. Throughout these results, we discuss how the insights gathered from this work may shape the design of future long-term studies to minimize user attrition and promote prolonged engagement.},

   abstract                      = {Universities often draw from their student body when conducting human subject studies. Unfortunately, as with any longitudinal human studies project, data quality problems arise from student's waning compliance to the study. While incentive mechanisms may be employed to boost student compliance, such systems may not encourage all participants in the same manner. This paper coupled student's compliance rates with other personal data collected via Fitbits, smartphones, and surveys. Machine learning algorithms were then employed to explore factors that influence compliance. With such insight, universities may target groups in their studies who are more likely to become non-compliant and implement preventative strategies such as tailoring their incentive mechanisms to accommodate a diverse population. In doing so, data quality problems stemming from failing compliance can be minimized.},
