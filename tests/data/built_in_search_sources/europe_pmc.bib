	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Preliminary evidence suggests that web-based physical activity interventions with tailored advice and Fitbit integration are effective and may be well suited to older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the engagement, acceptability, usability, and satisfaction with 'Active for Life,' a web-based physical activity intervention providing computer-tailored physical activity advice to older adults.<h4>Methods</h4>Inactive older adults (n = 243) were randomly assigned into 3 groups: 1) tailoring + Fitbit, 2) tailoring only, or 3) a wait-list control. The tailoring + Fitbit group and the tailoring-only group received 6 modules of computer-tailored physical activity advice over 12 weeks. The advice was informed by objective Fitbit data in the tailoring + Fitbit group and self-reported physical activity in the tailoring-only group. This study examined the engagement, acceptability, usability, and satisfaction of Active for Life in intervention participants (tailoring + Fitbit n = 78, tailoring only n = 96). Wait-list participants were not included. Engagement (Module completion, time on site) were objectively recorded through the intervention website. Acceptability (7-point Likert scale), usability (System Usability Scale), and satisfaction (open-ended questions) were assessed using an online survey at post intervention. ANOVA and Chi square analyses were conducted to compare outcomes between intervention groups and content analysis was used to analyse program satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>At post-intervention (week 12), study attrition was 28% (22/78) in the Fitbit + tailoring group and 39% (37/96) in the tailoring-only group. Engagement and acceptability were good in both groups, however there were no group differences (module completions: tailoring + Fitbit: 4.72 ± 2.04, Tailoring-only: 4.23 ± 2.25 out of 6 modules, p = .14, time on site: tailoring + Fitbit: 103.46 ± 70.63, Tailoring-only: 96.90 ± 76.37 min in total, p = .56, and acceptability of the advice: tailoring + Fitbit: 5.62 ± 0.89, Tailoring-only: 5.75 ± 0.75 out of 7, p = .41). Intervention usability was modest but significantly higher in the tailoring + Fitbit group (tailoring + Fitbit: 64.55 ± 13.59, Tailoring-only: 57.04 ± 2.58 out of 100, p = .003). Participants reported that Active for Life helped motivate them, held them accountable, improved their awareness of how active they were and helped them to become more active. Conversely, many participants felt as though they would prefer personal contact, more detailed tailoring and more survey response options.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study supports web-based physical activity interventions with computer-tailored advice and Fitbit integration as engaging and acceptable in older adults.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12618000646246.

	Abstract = {<h4>Purpose</h4>The commercialization of sleep activity tracking devices has made it possible to manage sleep quality at home. However, it is necessary to verify the reliability and accuracy of wearable devices through comparison with polysomnography (PSG), which is the standard for tracking sleep activity. This study aimed to monitor overall sleep activity using Fitbit Inspire 2™ (FBI2) and to evaluate its performance and effectiveness through PSG under the same conditions.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We compared the FBI2 and PSG data of nine participants (four male and five female participants; average age, 39 years) without severe sleeping problems. The participants wore FBI2 continuously for 14 days, considering the period of adaptation to the device. FBI2 and PSG sleep data were compared using paired <i>t</i>-tests, Bland-Altman plots, and epoch-by-epoch analysis for 18 samples by pooling data from two replicates.<h4>Results</h4>The average values for each sleep stage obtained from FBI2 and PSG showed significant differences in the total sleep time (TST), deep sleep, and rapid eye motion (REM). In the Bland-Altman analysis, TST (<i>P</i> = 0.02), deep sleep (<i>P</i> = 0.05), and REM (<i>P</i> = 0.03) were significantly overstated in FBI2 compared to PSG. In addition, time in bed, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset were overestimated, while light sleep was underestimated. However, these differences were not statistically significant. FBI2 showed a high sensitivity (93.9%) and low specificity (13.1%), with an accuracy of 76%. The sensitivity and specificity of each sleep stage was 54.3% and 62.3%, respectively, for light sleep, 84.8% and 50.1%, respectively, for deep sleep, and 86.4% and 59.1%, respectively for REM sleep.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of FBI2 as an objective tool for measuring sleep in daily life can be considered appropriate. However, further research is warranted on its application in participants with sleep-wake problems.},

The aim of this study was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using a Fitbit Charge 3 among people with dementia, living in the community, who took part in the physical exercise component of the Comprehensive REsilience-building psychoSocial intervenTion pilot study.<h4>Methods</h4>A mixed methods study was conducted; Quantitative data relating to wear rates for the Fitbit were recorded and qualitative data were collected by group and individual interviews with the people with dementia and their caregiver about their experience of wearing/using the Fitbit in the study.<h4>Results</h4>Nine people with dementia and their caregiver completed the intervention. Only one participant wore the Fitbit consistently. Supporting set-up and use of the devices was time consuming and caregiver involvement was essential for day-to-day support: none of the people with dementia owned a smartphone. Few of them engaged with the Fitbit features, primarily only using it to check the time and only a minority wanted to keep the device beyond the intervention.<h4>Discussion</h4>When designing a study using smart wearables such as a Fitbit among people with dementia, consideration should be given to the following: the possible burden on caregivers supporting the use of the device; a lack of familiarity with this technology in the target population; dealing with missing data, and the involvement of the researcher in setting up and supporting use of the device.},

	Abstract = {Tools for monitoring daily physical activity (PA) are desired by persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, current research-grade options are not suitable for longitudinal, independent use due to their cost and user experience. Our objective was to assess the validity of step counts and PA intensity metrics derived from the Fitbit Inspire HR, a consumer-grade PA tracker, in 45 persons with MS (Median age: 46, IQR: 40-51) undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. The population had moderate mobility impairment (Median EDSS 4.0, Range 2.0-6.5). We assessed the validity of Fitbit-derived PA metrics (Step count, total time in PA, time in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA)) during scripted tasks and free-living activity at three levels of data aggregation (minute, daily, and average PA). Criterion validity was assessed though agreement with manual counts and multiple methods for deriving PA metrics via the Actigraph GT3X. Convergent and known-groups validity were assessed via relationships with reference standards and related clinical measures. Fitbit-derived step count and time in PA, but not time in MVPA, exhibited excellent agreement with reference measures during scripted tasks. During free-living activity, step count and time in PA correlated moderately to strongly with reference measures, but agreement varied across metrics, data aggregation levels, and disease severity strata. Time in MVPA weakly agreed with reference measures. However, Fitbit-derived metrics were often as different from reference measures as reference measures were from each other. Fitbit-derived metrics consistently exhibited similar or stronger evidence of construct validity than reference standards. Fitbit-derived PA metrics are not equivalent to existing reference standards. However, they exhibit evidence of construct validity. Consumer-grade fitness trackers such as the Fitbit Inspire HR may therefore be suitable as a PA tracking tool for persons with mild or moderate MS.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Consumer-grade fitness trackers offer exciting opportunities to study persons with chronic diseases in greater detail and in their daily-life environment. However, attempts to bring fitness tracker measurement campaigns from tightly controlled clinical environments to home settings are often challenged by deteriorating study compliance or by organizational and resource limitations.<h4>Objectives</h4>By revisiting the study design and patient-reported experiences of a partly remote study with fitness trackers (BarKA-MS study), we aimed to qualitatively explore the relationship between overall study compliance and scalability. On that account, we aimed to derive lessons learned on strengths, weaknesses, and technical challenges for the conduct of future studies.<h4>Methods</h4>The two-phased BarKA-MS study employed Fitbit Inspire HR and electronic surveys to monitor physical activity in 45 people with multiple sclerosis in a rehabilitation setting and in their natural surroundings at home for up to 8 weeks. We examined and quantified the recruitment and compliance in terms of questionnaire completion and device wear time. Furthermore, we qualitatively evaluated experiences with devices according to participants' survey-collected reports. Finally, we reviewed the BarKA-MS study conduct characteristics for its scalability according to the Intervention Scalability Assessment Tool checklist.<h4>Results</h4>Weekly electronic surveys completion reached 96%. On average, the Fitbit data revealed 99% and 97% valid wear days at the rehabilitation clinic and in the home setting, respectively. Positive experiences with the device were predominant: only 17% of the feedbacks had a negative connotation, mostly pertaining to perceived measurement inaccuracies. Twenty-five major topics and study characteristics relating to compliance were identified. They broadly fell into the three categories: "effectiveness of support measures", "recruitment and compliance barriers", and "technical challenges". The scalability assessment revealed that the highly individualized support measures, which contributed greatly to the high study compliance, may face substantial scalability challenges due to the strong human involvement and limited potential for standardization.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The personal interactions and highly individualized participant support positively influenced study compliance and retention. But the major human involvement in these support actions will pose scalability challenges due to resource limitations. Study conductors should anticipate this potential compliance-scalability trade-off already in the design phase.},

To investigate this issue, 14 patients received a self-help guide booklet to improve sleep and wore the sleep tracker Fitbit Inspire 2 on their non-dominant hand for 4 weeks, while a control group of 12 patients only kept a handwritten sleep diary. All patients completed questionnaires at a primary care centre's first and final visit to assess general anxiety, sleep quality, sleep reactivity to stress, and quality of life. Our analysis showed that sleep quality, sleep reactivity to stress, and quality of life improved significantly for all patients between the first and final visit (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the Fitbit and control groups. Using sleep diary-derived estimates from the first and last week, we found that the control group but not the Fitbit group, increased their average time asleep each night and sleep efficiency (p < 0.05). However, these differences were primarily driven by baseline differences between the two groups. Our findings suggest that using wearables does not necessarily exacerbate sleep worries among people with insomnia.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Wearable devices collect physiological and behavioral data that have the potential to identify individuals at risk of declining mental health and well-being. Past research has mainly focused on assessing the accuracy and the agreement of heart rate (HR) measurement of wearables under different physical exercise conditions. However, the capacity of wearables to sense physiological changes, assessed by increasing HR, caused by a stressful event has not been thoroughly studied.<h4>Objective</h4>This study followed 3 objectives: (1) to test the ability of a wearable device (Fitbit Versa 2) to sense an increase in HR upon induction of psychological stress in the laboratory; (2) to assess the accuracy of the wearable device to capture short-term HR variations caused by psychological stress compared to a gold-standard electrocardiogram (ECG) measure (Biopac); and (3) to quantify the degree of agreement between the wearable device and the gold-standard ECG measure across different experimental conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test protocol, which consists of an oral phase, an arithmetic stress phase, an anticipation phase, and 2 relaxation phases (at the beginning and the end). During the stress protocol, the participants wore a Fitbit Versa 2 and were also connected to a Biopac. A mixed-effect modeling approach was used (1) to assess the effect of experimental conditions on HR, (2) to estimate several metrics of accuracy, and (3) to assess the agreement: the Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LoA), the concordance correlation coefficient, the coverage probability, the total deviation index, and the coefficient of an individual agreement. Mean absolute error and mean absolute percent error were calculated as accuracy indices.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 34 university students were recruited for this study (64% of participants were female with a mean age of 26.8 years, SD 8.3). Overall, the results showed significant HR variations across experimental phases. Post hoc tests revealed significant pairwise differences for all phases. Accuracy analyses revealed acceptable accuracy according to the analyzed metrics of accuracy for the Fitbit Versa 2 to capture the short-term variations in psychological stress levels. However, poor indices of agreement between the Fitbit Versa 2 and the Biopac were found.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, the results support the use of the Fitbit Versa 2 to capture short-term stress variations. The Fitbit device showed acceptable levels of accuracy but poor agreement with an ECG gold standard. Greater inaccuracy and smaller agreement were found for stressful experimental conditions that induced a higher HR. Fitbit devices can be used in research to measure HR variations caused by stress, although they cannot replace an ECG instrument when precision is of utmost importance.},

Commonly owned digital devices and services like smartphones and text-messaging are highly used among adolescents and are promising intervention tools for reaching this age group. Personal activity trackers assess activity and sleep, making them ideal tools for addressing these behaviors. We propose to examine the feasibility of a 12-week intervention that uses theoretically grounded text messages and a Fitbit device to improve PA and sleep among Hispanic adolescents with obesity, as compared to a wait-list control group with a Fitbit device only.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants (N = 48; 14-16 years) will be randomized (1:1) to the intervention or wait-list control group. Youth in the intervention will receive a Fitbit Charge 5 and daily text messages. Youth in the wait-list control group will receive a Fitbit Charge 5 and information on PA and sleep guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>Feasibility will be examined by collecting process evaluation data on the following criteria: (1) recruit 48 Hispanic adolescents 14-16 years; (2) retain 85% of participants for post-assessments; (3) Fitbit wear ≥4 days/week and respond to 80% of text messages when prompted; (4) ≤10% technical issues; and (5) obtain 80% satisfaction from participants.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study will advance our knowledge on the feasibility of digital prevention strategies to promote PA and sleep behaviors to reduce T2D risk among Hispanic youth. If feasible, this approach has the potential to be a scalable, cost-effective diabetes prevention strategy among high-risk youth.<h4>Trial registration</h4>NCT04953442, registered on July 8, 2021.},

Improving patient outcomes and patient satisfaction after TJR remain important goals. Wearable technologies provide a novel way to capture patient function and activity data and supplement clinical measures and patient-reported outcome measures in order to better understand patient outcomes after TJR.<h4>Objective</h4>We examined the current literature to evaluate the potential role of wearable devices and compare them with existing methods for monitoring and improving patient rehabilitation and outcomes following TJR.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a literature search by using the research databases supported by the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School's Lamar Soutter Library, including PubMed and Scopus, supplemented with the Google Scholar search engine. A specific search strategy was used to identify articles discussing the use of wearable devices in measuring and affecting postoperative outcomes of patients who have undergone TJR. Selected papers were organized into a spreadsheet and categorized for our qualitative literature review to assess how wearable data correlated with clinical measures and patient-reported outcome measures.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 9 papers were selected. The literature showed the impact of wearable devices on evaluating and improving postoperative functional outcomes. Wearable-collected data could be used to predict postoperative clinical measures, such as range of motion and Timed Up and Go times. When predicting patient-reported outcomes, specifically Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores/Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey scores, strong associations were found between changes in sensor-collected data and changes in patient-reported outcomes over time. Further, the step counts of patients who received feedback from a wearable improved over time when compared to those of patients who did not receive feedback.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings suggest that wearable technology has the potential to remotely measure and improve postoperative orthopedic patient outcomes. We anticipate that this review will facilitate further investigation into whether wearable devices are viable tools for guiding the clinical management of TJR rehabilitation.},

Increasing physical activity (PA) may improve QOL, but this has been understudied in YBCS. This single arm pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a 3-month, peer-delivered, remote intervention to increase PA and improve QOL in YBCS. Data were collected from October 2019 - July 2020. Participants (n = 34, 43.1 ± 5.5 years old, 46 ± 34.4 months post-diagnosis, BMI = 30.2 ± 7.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed six video sessions with a trained peer mentor; self-monitored PA with a Fitbit activity tracker; and interacted with a private Fitbit Community for social support. At baseline, 3-and 6-months, participants completed QOL questionnaires and PA was measured through accelerometer (moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA]) and self-report (strength and flexibility). A parallel mixed-methods approach (qualitative interviews and quantitative satisfaction survey at 3-months) explored intervention feasibility and acceptability. One-way repeated-measures ANOVAs examined impacts on PA and QOL at 3-and 6-months. The intervention was feasible as evidenced by efficient recruitment, high retention, and adherence to intervention components. Remote delivery, working with a peer mentor, and using Fitbit tools were highly acceptable. From baseline to 3-months, participants increased time spent in objectively measured MVPA, strength, and flexibility exercises, and reported meaningful improvements to body image, fatigue, anxiety, and emotional support. A fully remote, peer-to-peer intervention is an acceptable and promising strategy to increase PA and improve QOL in YBCS. Refinements to the intervention and its delivery should be further assessed in future studies, toward the goal of disseminating an evidence-based, scalable intervention to the growing number of YBCS.Trial registration Prospectively registered as NCT04064892.},

During the remaining 9 weeks of the study, weekly step counts increased by an average of 67 (95% CI -30 to 163; P<.001) steps per week, resulting in a final estimate of 8258 (95% CI 6933-9584; P<.001) steps.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Participants showed a marked improvement in daily step counts during the first 3 weeks of the study, followed by more gradual improvement in the remaining 9 weeks. Physical activity data and step count recovery trajectories may be considered surrogates for physiological recovery, although further research is needed to examine this relationship.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04663945; https://tinyurl.com/2p969ced.},

	Abstract = {Recent growth in digital technologies has enabled the recruitment and monitoring of large and diverse populations in remote health studies. However, the generalizability of inference drawn from remotely collected health data could be severely impacted by uneven participant engagement and attrition over the course of the study. We report findings on long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in a large multinational observational digital study for depression containing active (surveys) and passive sensor data collected via Android smartphones, and Fitbit devices from 614 participants for up to 2 years. Majority of participants (67.6%) continued to remain engaged in the study after 43 weeks. Unsupervised clustering of participants' study apps and Fitbit usage data showed 3 distinct engagement subgroups for each data stream. We found: (i) the least engaged group had the highest depression severity (4 PHQ8 points higher) across all data streams; (ii) the least engaged group (completed 4 bi-weekly surveys) took significantly longer to respond to survey notifications (3.8 h more) and were 5 years younger compared to the most engaged group (completed 20 bi-weekly surveys); and (iii) a considerable proportion (44.6%) of the participants who stopped completing surveys after 8 weeks continued to share passive Fitbit data for significantly longer (average 42 weeks). Additionally, multivariate survival models showed participants' age, ownership and brand of smartphones, and recruitment sites to be associated with retention in the study. Together these findings could inform the design of future digital health studies to enable equitable and balanced data collection from diverse populations.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Sedentary behavior (SB) is prevalent after abdominal cancer surgery, and interventions targeting perioperative SB could improve postoperative recovery and outcomes. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a real-time mobile intervention that detects and disrupts prolonged SB before and after cancer surgery, relative to a monitoring-only control condition.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a perioperative SB intervention on objective activity behavior, patient-reported quality of life and symptoms, and 30-day readmissions.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients scheduled for surgery for metastatic gastrointestinal cancer (n=26) were enrolled and randomized to receive either the SB intervention or activity monitoring only. Both groups used a Fitbit smartwatch and companion smartphone app to rate daily symptoms and collect continuous objective activity behavior data starting from at least 10 days before surgery through 30 days post discharge. Participants in the intervention group also received prompts to walk after any SB bout that exceeded a prespecified threshold, with less frequent prompts on days that patients reported more severe symptoms. Participants completed end-of-study ratings of acceptability, and we also examined adherence to assessments and to walking prompts. In addition, we examined effects of the intervention on objective SB and step counts, patient-reported quality of life and depressive and physical symptoms, as well as readmissions.<h4>Results</h4>Accrual (74%), retention (88%), and acceptability ratings (mean overall satisfaction 88.5/100, SD 9.1) were relatively high. However, adherence to assessments and engagement with the SB intervention decreased significantly after surgery and did not recover to preoperative levels after postoperative discharge. All participants exhibited significant increases in SB and symptoms and decreases in steps and quality of life after surgery, and participants randomized to the SB intervention unexpectedly had longer maximum SB bouts relative to the control group. No significant benefits of the intervention with regard to activity, quality of life, symptoms, or readmission were observed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Perioperative patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancer were interested in a real-time SB intervention and rated the intervention as highly acceptable, but engagement with the intervention and with daily symptom and activity monitoring decreased significantly after surgery. There were no significant effects of the intervention on step counts, patient-reported quality of life or symptoms, and postoperative readmissions, and there was an apparent adverse effect on maximum SB. Results highlight the need for additional work to modify the intervention to make reducing SB and engaging with mobile health technology after abdominal cancer surgery more feasible and beneficial.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03211806; https://tinyurl.com/3napwkkt.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment; however, poor adherence to CPAP is common. Current guidelines specify 4 hours of CPAP use per night as a target to define adequate treatment adherence. However, effective OSA treatment requires CPAP use during the entire time spent in bed to optimally treat respiratory events and prevent adverse health effects associated with the time spent sleeping without wearing a CPAP device. Nightly sleep patterns vary considerably, making it necessary to measure CPAP adherence relative to the time spent in bed. Weight loss is an important goal for patients with OSA. Tools are required to address these clinical challenges in patients with OSA.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop a mobile health tool that combined weight loss features with novel CPAP adherence tracking (ie, percentage of CPAP wear time relative to objectively assessed time spent in bed) for patients with OSA.<h4>Methods</h4>We used an iterative, user-centered process to design a new CPAP adherence tracking module that integrated with an existing weight loss app. A total of 37 patients with OSA aged 20 to 65 years were recruited. In phase 1, patients with OSA who were receiving CPAP treatment (n=7) tested the weight loss app to track nutrition, activity, and weight for 10 days. Participants completed a usability and acceptability survey. In phase 2, patients with OSA who were receiving CPAP treatment (n=21) completed a web-based survey about their interpretations and preferences for wireframes of the CPAP tracking module. In phase 3, patients with recently diagnosed OSA who were CPAP naive (n=9) were prescribed a CPAP device (ResMed AirSense10 AutoSet) and tested the integrated app for 3 to 4 weeks. Participants completed a usability survey and provided feedback.<h4>Results</h4>During phase 1, participants found the app to be mostly easy to use, except for some difficulty searching for specific foods. All participants found the connected devices (Fitbit activity tracker and Fitbit Aria scale) easy to use and helpful. During phase 2, participants correctly interpreted CPAP adherence success, expressed as percentage of wear time relative to time spent in bed, and preferred seeing a clearly stated percentage goal ("Goal: 100%"). In phase 3, participants found the integrated app easy to use and requested push notification reminders to wear CPAP before bedtime and to sync Fitbit in the morning.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a mobile health tool that integrated a new CPAP adherence tracking module into an existing weight loss app. Novel features included addressing OSA-obesity comorbidity, CPAP adherence tracking via percentage of CPAP wear time relative to objectively assessed time spent in bed, and push notifications to foster adherence. Future research on the effectiveness of this tool in improving OSA treatment adherence is warranted.},

Participants were asked to walk 150 min per week at a comfortable and safe pace. Patient-reported outcome measures (PRO) were collected at baseline and follow-up.<h4>Results</h4>Target recruitment of 60 patients was achieved. In 52 patients who completed all baseline measures, mean age was 55 (SD 11.1), 23% were pre-menopausal, and 19% non-White. Forty patients (77%) were retained at 3 months and 29 (56%) at 6 months. Baseline walking was the strongest predictor of retention at 3 months (P = .02). For 24 patients (46%) with analyzable Fitbit data at 3 months, mean steps/week rose from 19,175 to 31,306.

People with CVD have higher rates of depression than those without and have higher mortality rates if they have comorbid depression. While physical activity (PA) improves both, few people engage in enough. We compared self-guided internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) + Fitbit or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) + Fitbit, with Fitbit only to increase daily steps for participants with depression who have low PA.<h4>Methods</h4>Adult participants (N = 340) were recruited from two online patient-powered research networks and randomized to one of three study interventions for 8 weeks with an additional 8 weeks of follow-up. Using linear mixed effects models, we evaluated the effect of the intervention on average daily steps (NCT03373110).<h4>Results</h4>Average daily steps increased 2.8 steps per day in MBCT+Fitbit, 2.9 steps/day in CBT + Fitbit, but decreased 8.2 steps/day in Fitbit Only. These changes were not statistically different between the MBCT+Fitbit and CBT + Fitbit groups, but were different from Fitbit Only across the initial 8-week period. Group differences were not maintained across follow-up. Exploratory analyses identified comorbid anxiety disorders, self-reported PA, and employment status as moderators.<h4>Discussion</h4>Changes in daily steps over both 8- and 16-week periods-regardless of intervention group-were minimal. The results emphasize the limits of using self-guided web-based psychotherapy with an activity tracker to increase PA in participants with a history of depression and low PA.},

PA was measured with the activity tracker Fitbit Charge 3 for 12 weeks. Control group data was obtained from ≈60,000 Fitbit users, matched on age, sex and measurement period. PA variables [steps, intensities, volume, activity types, exercise frequencies and proportion meeting the World Health Organization's moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) recommendations] were compared between groups descriptively and using Welch's two-sample t-test and two-sample test of proportions.<h4>Results</h4>Forty PWH A were enrolled (mean age 19.5 years, 50% teenagers, 50% adults, three (7.5%) with moderate and 37 (92.5%) with severe haemophilia). Mean daily steps and minutes MVPA were similar between PWH and controls. PWH spent more time in light PA (mean 227 vs. 192 min/day, P = .033) and exercised more frequently (mean 5.6 vs. 3.9 exercise sessions/week, P < .001). Among teenagers, 40% PWH and 8% controls reached MVPA recommendations, compared to 95% and 100% among adults. The most common type of PA was walking.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This cohort of young PWH A on prophylactic treatment had PA levels comparable to controls. Still, a considerable proportion of teenagers did not meet the recommended weekly volume of MVPA, and we encourage clinicians to have a particular focus on promoting PA for this group.},

This predicament raises a crucial issue regarding the privacy of the users and their awareness on how their personal data are shared and potentially used. The immense increase in fitness trackers use has further increased the amount of user data generated, processed and possibly shared or sold to third parties, enabling the extraction of further insights about the users. In this work, we investigate if the analysis and exploitation of the data collected by fitness trackers can lead to the extraction of inferences about the owners routines, health status or other sensitive information.

A database search (Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus) for original research articles was performed. A total of twenty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, and the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used. Wearable technology can actually be a very important instrument/tool to detect the movements and monitor the physical activity of children and adolescents. The results revealed that there are a few studies on the influence of these technologies on physical activity in schools, and most of them are descriptive. In line with previous research, the wearable devices can be used as a motivational tool to improve PA behaviors and in the evaluation of PA interventions. However, the different reliability levels of the different devices used in the studies can compromise the analysis and understanding of the results.},

Although there is growing evidence for the use of smart wearables to benefit physical health, more research is required on the feasibility of using these devices for mental health and well-being. In studies focusing on emotion recognition, emotions are often inferred and dependent on external cues, which may not be representative of true emotional states.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using consumer-grade activity trackers for apps in the remote mental health monitoring of older aged people.<h4>Methods</h4>Older adults were recruited using criterion sampling. Participants were provided an activity tracker (Fitbit Alta HR) and completed weekly online questionnaires, including the Geriatric Depression Scale, for 4 weeks. Before and after the study period, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted to provide insight into the acceptance and feasibility of performing the protocol over a 4-week period. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 12 participants enrolled in the study, and 9 returned for interviews after the study period. Participants had positive attitudes toward being remotely monitored, with 78% (7/9) of participants experiencing no inconvenience throughout the study period. Moreover, 67% (6/9) were interested in trialing our prototype when it is implemented. Participants stated they would feel more comfortable if mental well-being was being monitored by carers remotely.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Fitbit-like devices were an unobtrusive and convenient tool to collect physiological user data. Future research should integrate physiological user inputs to differentiate and predict depressive tendencies in users.},

	Abstract = {When children are discharged from the hospital after surgery, caregivers rely mainly on subjective assessments (e.g., appetite, fatigue) to identify abnormal recovery symptoms since objective monitoring tools (e.g., thermometer) are very limited at home. Relying on such tools alone has resulted in unwarranted emergency department visits and delayed care. This study evaluated the ability of data from consumer-grade wearable devices, the Fitbit Inspire HR and Inspire 2, to predict abnormal symptoms and complications in children recovering after appendectomy. One hundred and sixty-two children, ages 3–17 years old, who underwent an appendectomy (76 simple and 86 complicated cases of appendicitis) wore a Fitbit device on their wrist for 21 days postoperatively. Symptoms and complications that arose during this monitoring period were gathered from medical records and patient report and used to label each postoperative day as either “abnormal recovery” or “normal recovery.” Fitbit-derived physical activity, heart rate, and sleep features and demographic and clinical characteristics were used to train balanced random forest classifiers to predict abnormal recovery days, separately for patients undergoing appendectomy for simple and complicated appendicitis. The classifiers accurately predicted 85% of abnormal recovery days up to the two days prior to the onset of a reported symptom/complication in complicated appendectomy patients and 70% of abnormal recovery days up to the two days prior in simple appendectomy patients. These results support the development of machine learning algorithms to predict onset of complications in children undergoing surgery and the role of the Fitbit as a monitoring tool for early detection of events.},

Consistent users had lower body mass index z-scores at enrollment (0.4 ± 0.7 vs. 1.2 ± 0.9; <i>p</i> = 0.01), but were otherwise comparable with inconsistent users. Over time survivors' use declined; at 12 months, only one participant was using his or her Fitbit. Survivors who completed a survey (<i>n</i> = 22) reported their Fitbit helped them self-monitor their exercise (72.7%, 16/22) and lead a more active lifestyle (63.6%, 14/22), but found it challenging to charge and not lose, forget about, or break the device. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In the real-world setting, only a small subset of adolescent-aged survivors will initially consistently use a Fitbit and their interest diminishes over time. To maximize engagement, interventions incorporating wearable activity trackers likely need to include additional behavior change strategies.},

	Abstract = {Ubiquitous self-tracking technologies have penetrated various aspects of our lives, from physical and mental health monitoring to fitness and entertainment. Yet, limited data exist on the association between in the wild large-scale physical activity patterns, sleep, stress, and overall health, and behavioral and psychological patterns due to challenges in collecting and releasing such datasets, including waning user engagement or privacy considerations. In this paper, we present the LifeSnaps dataset, a multi-modal, longitudinal, and geographically-distributed dataset containing a plethora of anthropological data, collected unobtrusively for the total course of more than 4 months by n = 71 participants. LifeSnaps contains more than 35 different data types from second to daily granularity, totaling more than 71 M rows of data. The participants contributed their data through validated surveys, ecological momentary assessments, and a Fitbit Sense smartwatch and consented to make these data available to empower future research. We envision that releasing this large-scale dataset of multi-modal real-world data will open novel research opportunities and potential applications in multiple disciplines.},

This study aims at evaluating the usability of three wrist-worn monitors for older adults. In addition, we report on usability (including data management) for research.<h4>Design</h4>Data were collected cross-sectionally. Between-person of three activity monitor type (Apple Watch 3, Fitbit Charge 4, Polar A370) were made.<h4>Setting</h4>The activity monitors were worn in normal daily life in an urban community in Germany. The period of wear was 2 weeks.<h4>Participants</h4>Using convenience sampling, we recruited N=27 healthy older adults (≥60 years old) who were not already habitual users of activity monitors.<h4>Outcomes</h4>To evaluate usability from the participant perspective, we used the System Usability Scale (SUS) as well as a study-specific qualitative checklist. Assessment further comprised age, highest academic degree, computer proficiency and affinity for technology interaction. Usability from the researchers' perspective was assessed using quantitative data management markers and a study-specific qualitative check-list.<h4>Results</h4>There was no significant difference between monitors in the SUS. Female gender was associated with higher SUS usability ratings. Qualitative participant-usability reports revealed distinctive shortcomings, for example, in terms of battery life and display readability. Usability for researchers came with problems in data management, such as completeness of the data download.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The usability of the monitors compared in this work differed qualitatively. Yet, the overall usability ratings by participants were comparable. Conversely, from the researchers' perspective, there were crucial differences in data management and usability that should be considered when making monitor choices for future studies.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Innovative approaches are needed to understand barriers to and facilitators of physical activity among insufficiently active adults. Although social comparison processes (ie, self-evaluations relative to others) are often used to motivate physical activity in digital environments, user preferences and responses to comparison information are poorly understood.<h4>Objective</h4>We used an iterative approach to better understand users' selection of comparison targets, how they interacted with their selected targets, and how they responded to these targets.<h4>Methods</h4>Across 3 studies, different samples of insufficiently active college students used the Fitbit system (Fitbit LLC) to track their steps per day as well as a separate, adaptive web platform each day for 7 to 9 days (N=112). The adaptive platform was designed with different layouts for each study; each allowed participants to select their preferred comparison target from various sets of options, view the desired amount of information about their selected target, and rate their physical activity motivation before and after viewing information about their selected target. Targets were presented as achieving physical activity at various levels below and above their own, which were accessed via the Fitbit system each day. We examined the types of comparison target selections, time spent viewing and number of elements viewed for each type of target, and day-level associations between comparison selections and physical activity outcomes (motivation and behavior).<h4>Results</h4>Study 1 (n=5) demonstrated that the new web platform could be used as intended and that participants' interactions with the platform (ie, the type of target selected, the time spent viewing the selected target's profile, and the number of profile elements viewed) varied across the days. Studies 2 (n=53) and 3 (n=54) replicated these findings; in both studies, age was positively associated with time spent viewing the selected target's profile and the number of profile elements viewed. Across all studies, upward targets (who had more steps per day than the participant) were selected more often than downward targets (who had fewer steps per day than the participant), although only a subset of either type of target selection was associated with benefits for physical activity motivation or behavior.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Capturing physical activity-based social comparison preferences is feasible in an adaptive digital environment, and day-to-day differences in preferences for social comparison targets are associated with day-to-day changes in physical activity motivation and behavior. Findings show that participants only sometimes focus on the comparison opportunities that support their physical activity motivation or behavior, which helps explain previous, equivocal findings regarding the benefits of physical activity-based comparisons. Additional investigation of day-level determinants of comparison selections and responses is needed to fully understand how best to harness comparison processes in digital tools to promote physical activity.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>Stroke survivors usually experience long-lasting functional, emotional and social consequences that might contribute to sedentary behaviour and participation restrictions, which are important targets to address during rehabilitation. However, the trajectory and inter-relationship between these factors are unknown.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Part&Sed is a research project based on an observational study design with 6 and 12 months of follow-ups in stroke survivors. In addition, a qualitative analysis of the impact of the stroke on the stroke survivor, validation of the Satisfaction with Daily Occupation-Occupational Balance assessment tool and analysis of the reliability of the Fitbit Inspire 2 activity tracker wristband will be carried out. Participants will be chronic stroke survivors with independent walking capacity. Sociodemographic and clinical data, physical activity, ambulation, sleep, quality of life, anxiety and depression, community participation, and occupational satisfaction and balance, as well as data provided by the activity tracker wristband, will be collected. In addition, if the participant has a primary caregiver, the caregiver will also be monitored. A minimum of 130 participants will be recruited to conduct a random-effects multiple regression model. Mixed models for repeated measures will assess the variation over time of the different variables associated with participation and sedentary behaviour. Psychometric properties (eg, internal consistency, construct validity, test-retest reliability) of the Satisfaction with Daily Occupation-Occupational Balance will be determined. Additionally, intraclass correlation coefficients and minimum detectable change will be calculated to assess intrasubject reliability of physical activity and sleep parameters recorded by the Fitbit Inspire 2. The qualitative analysis process will be carried out using the analysis proposed by Giorgi.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study received ethical approval from the Spanish Regional Ethics Committee 'Comité de Ética de la Investigación de la Comunidad de Aragón' (PI21/333). The results will be made available via peer-reviewed publications, international conferences and official channels.},

	Abstract = {Wearable devices are increasingly popular in clinical and non-clinical populations as a tool for exercise prescription, monitoring of daily physical activity and nutrition, and health-related parameters management. In this regard, smart devices not only assist people in pursuing a healthier lifestyle, but also provide a constant stream of physiological and metabolic data for management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Although the benefits of lifestyle-based interventions (exercise and nutrition) for NCDs are well known, the potential of wearable devices to promote healthy behaviors in clinical populations is still controversial. In this narrative review, we aimed to discuss the current application of wearable devices in NCDs, highlighting their role in prescribing and monitoring daily physical activity and dietary habits in the population living with chronic diseases. None of the studies considered specifically addressed the efficacy of the use of wearable devices, and limited are those that incorporate monitoring of both physical activity and nutrition for NCDs. However, there is evidence that such devices have helped improve physical activity levels, physical fitness, body composition, and metabolic and psychological parameters. Therefore, the authors believe that the benefits obtained from the use of wearable devices are likely to translate to public health and represent one of the important tools for the development of prevention plans in everyday life and clinical practice for optimal patient management.},

	Abstract = {Physical health status defines an individual's ability to perform normal activities of daily living and is usually assessed in clinical settings by questionnaires and/or by validated tests, e.g. timed walk tests. These measurements have relatively low information content and are usually limited in frequency. Wearable sensors, such as activity monitors, enable remote measurement of parameters associated with physical activity but have not been widely explored beyond measurement of daily step count. Here we report on results from a cohort of 22 individuals with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) who were provided with a Fitbit activity monitor (Fitbit Charge HR<sup>®</sup>) between two clinic visits (18.4 ± 12.2 weeks). At each clinical visit, a maximum of 26 measurements were recorded (19 categorical and 7 continuous). From analysis of the minute-to-minute step rate and heart rate we derive several metrics associated with physical activity and cardiovascular function. These metrics are used to identify subgroups within the cohort and to compare to clinical parameters. Several Fitbit metrics are strongly correlated to continuous clinical parameters. Using a thresholding approach, we show that many Fitbit metrics result in statistically significant differences in clinical parameters between subgroups, including those associated with physical status, cardiovascular function, pulmonary function, as well as biomarkers from blood tests. These results highlight the fact that daily step count is only one of many metrics that can be derived from activity monitors.},

We aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a 12-week intervention coupling a wearable activity tracker (FitBit ®) and structured feedback coaching vs. wearable activity tracker alone on changes in physical activity in hemodialysis patients.<h4>Study design</h4>Randomized controlled trial.<h4>Settings and participants</h4>55 participants with ESKD receiving hemodialysis who were able to walk with or without assistive devices were recruited from a single academic hemodialysis unit between Jan 2019 and April 2020.<h4>Interventions</h4>All participants wore a Fitbit® Charge 2 tracker for a minimum of 12 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to a wearable activity tracker plus a structured feedback intervention versus the wearable activity tracker alone. The structured feedback group was counseled weekly on steps achieved after randomization.<h4>Outcomes</h4>The outcome was step count and the main parameter of interest was the absolute change in daily step count, averaged per week, from baseline to completion of 12 weeks intervention. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mixed-effect linear regression analysis was used to evaluate change in daily step count from baseline to 12-weeks in both arms.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 55 participants, 46 participants completed the 12-week intervention (23 per arm). The mean age was 62 (standard deviation [SD] 14) years; 44% were Black, and 36% were Hispanic. At baseline, step count (structured feedback intervention: 3704 [1594] vs. wearable activity tracker alone: 3808 [1890]) and other participant characteristics were balanced between arms. We observed a larger change in daily step count in the structured feedback arm at 12 weeks relative to use of the wearable activity tracker alone arm (Δ 920 [SD 580] versus Δ 281 [SD 186] steps; between-group difference Δ 639 [SD 538] steps; P <0.05).<h4>Limitations</h4>Single center study and small sample size.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This pilot randomized controlled trial demonstrated that structured feedback coupled with a wearable activity tracker leads to a greater daily step count that was sustained over 12 weeks relative to a wearable activity tracker alone. Future studies are required to determine longer-term sustainability of the intervention and potential health benefits in hemodialysis patients.<h4>Funding</h4>Grants from industry (Satellite Healthcare) and government (National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).},

Many consumer wearables contain optical photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to measure pulse rate. PPG-based software algorithms that detect irregular heart rhythms may identify undiagnosed AF in large populations using wearables, but minimizing false-positive detections is essential.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a prospective remote clinical trial to examine a novel PPG-based algorithm for detecting undiagnosed AF from a range of wrist-worn devices. Adults aged ≥22 years in the United States without AF, using compatible wearable Fitbit devices and Android or iOS smartphones, were included. PPG data were analyzed using a novel algorithm that examines overlapping 5-minute pulse windows (tachograms). Eligible participants with an irregular heart rhythm detection (IHRD), defined as 11 consecutive irregular tachograms, were invited to schedule a telehealth visit and were mailed a 1-week ambulatory ECG patch monitor. The primary outcome was the positive predictive value of the first IHRD during ECG patch monitoring for concurrent AF.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 455 699 participants enrolled (median age 47 years, 71% female, 73% White) between May 6 and October 1, 2020. IHRDs occurred for 4728 (1%) participants, and 2070 (4%) participants aged ≥65 years during a median of 122 (interquartile range, 110-134) days at risk for an IHRD. Among 1057 participants with an IHRD notification and subsequent analyzable ECG patch monitor, AF was present in 340 (32.2%). Of the 225 participants with another IHRD during ECG patch monitoring, 221 had concurrent AF on the ECG and 4 did not, resulting in an IHRD positive predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI, 95.5%-99.5%). For participants aged ≥65 years, the IHRD positive predictive value was 97.0% (95% CI, 91.4%-99.4%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel PPG software algorithm for wearable Fitbit devices exhibited a high positive predictive value for concurrent AF and identified participants likely to have AF on subsequent ECG patch monitoring.

Among the strategies used to attract and engage students in campus recreation programs and services, health coaching shows some promise as a potentially effective intervention strategy. This study examined the efficacy of a university campus recreation health coaching program. Students from Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines (n = 34) were provided with individual, group, and virtual support to assist in developing effective strategies for academic success. Fitbit data measuring participants’ sleep and physical activity were collected along with self-reported measures of stress and perceived happiness and focus group qualitative data focused on participants’ perceptions of the program. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic forcing the program to adapt, findings suggest that health coaching may be an effective intervention strategy to help university students cope with the heightened anxiety and stress levels associated with campus life.},

Black women (58%) are affected by higher rates of hypertension than other racial/ethnic groups contributing to increased cardio-metabolic disorders. To decrease blood pressure (BP) in this population, a pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effects of Interactive Technology Enhanced Coaching (ITEC) versus Interactive Technology (IT) alone in achieving BP control, adherence to antihypertensive medication, and adherence to lifestyle modifications among Black women diagnosed with and receiving medication for their hypertension. Participants completed a 6-week Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP), and 83 participants were randomly assigned to ITEC versus IT. Participants were trained to use three wireless tools and five apps that were synchronized to smartphones to monitor BP, weight, physical activity (steps), diet (caloric and sodium intake), and medication adherence. Fitbit Plus, a cloud-based collaborative care platform was used to collect, track, and store data. Using a mixed-effects repeated measures model, the main effect of group means indicated no significant difference between the treatment and referent groups on study variables. The main effect of time indicated significant differences between repeated measures for systolic BP (p < .0001), weight (p < .0001), and steps (p = .018). An interaction effect revealed differences over time and was significant for study measures except diastolic BP. An important goal of this preliminary analysis is to help Black women prioritize self-care management in their everyday environment. Future research is warranted in a geographically broader population of hypertensive Black women.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Glucose variability increases cardiometabolic disease risk. While many factors can influence glucose levels, postprandial glucose response is the primary driver of glucose variability. Furthermore, affect may directly and indirectly impact glucose variability through its effect on eating behavior. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) facilitate the real-time evaluation of blood glucose, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can be used to assess affect in real time. Together, data collected from these sources provide the opportunity to further understand the role of affect in glucose levels.<h4>Objective</h4>This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to (1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using CGMs along with EMA in nondiabetic populations and (2) examine the bidirectional relationship between affect and glucose in nondiabetic adults with overweight or obesity using a CGM and EMA.<h4>Methods</h4>Eligibility criteria for the study include participants (1) aged 18 to 65 years old, (2) with a BMI of ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, (3) who are able to read and write in English, and (4) who own a smartphone. Individuals will be excluded if they (1) have type 1 or 2 diabetes or have any other condition that requires glucose monitoring, (2) are pregnant, (3) use any medications that have the potential to alter blood glucose levels or interfere with the glucose sensing process, or (4) have a diagnosed gastrointestinal condition or eating disorder. In a 14-day observational study, participants will wear a FreeStyle Libre Pro CGM sensor (Abbott) and will receive mobile phone-based EMA prompts 6 times per day (randomly within six 2-hour windows between 8 AM and 8 PM) to assess positive and negative affect. Participants will also wear a Fitbit Inspire 2 (Fitbit) to continuously monitor physical activity and sleep, which will be included as covariates in the analysis. Multilevel linear regression models will be used to evaluate the acute relationship between glucose level and affect.<h4>Results</h4>Recruitment started in October 2022 and is expected to be completed in March 2023. We will aim to recruit 100 participants. As of December 12, 2022, a total of 39 participants have been enrolled.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study will further elucidate the role of affect in glucose variability. By identifying affective states that may lead to glucose excursions, our findings could inform just-in-time behavioral interventions by indicating opportunities for intervention delivery.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/45104.},

	Abstract = {Our research aims to assess the performance of a new generation of consumer activity trackers (Fitbit Charge 4TM: FBC) to measure sleep variables and sleep stage classifications in patients with chronic insomnia, compared to polysomnography (PSG) and a widely used actigraph (Actiwatch Spectrum Pro: AWS). We recruited 37 participants, all diagnosed with chronic insomnia disorder, for one night of sleep monitoring in a sleep laboratory using PSG, AWS, and FBC. Epoch-by-epoch analysis along with Bland-Altman plots was used to evaluate FBC and AWS against PSG for sleep-wake detection and sleep variables: total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), waking after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset latency (SOL). FBC sleep stage classification of light sleep (LS), deep sleep (DS), and rapid eye movement (REM) was also compared to that of PSG. When compared with PSG, FBC notably underestimated DS (-41.4, p < 0.0001) and SE (-4.9%, p = 0.0016), while remarkably overestimating LS (37.7, p = 0.0012). However, the TST, WASO, and SOL assessed by FBC presented no significant difference from that assessed by PSG. Compared with PSG, AWS and FBC showed great accuracy (86.9% vs. 86.5%) and sensitivity (detecting sleep; 92.6% vs. 89.9%), but comparatively poor specificity (detecting wake; 35.7% vs. 62.2%). Both devices showed better accuracy in assessing sleep than wakefulness, with the same sensitivity but statistically different specificity. FBC supplied equivalent parameters estimation as AWS in detecting sleep variables except for SE. This research shows that FBC cannot replace PSG thoroughly in the quantification of sleep variables and classification of sleep stages in Chinese patients with chronic insomnia; however, the user-friendly and low-cost wearables do show some comparable functions. Whether FBC can serve as a substitute for actigraphy and PSG in patients with chronic insomnia needs further investigation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Cancer supportive care interventions often have limited generalizability, goal misalignment, and high costs. We developed and piloted a health coaching intervention, UNC HealthScore, in patients undergoing cancer treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04923997). We present feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcome data.<h4>Methods</h4>HealthScore is a six-month, theory-based, multicomponent intervention delivered through participant-driven coaching sessions. For the pilot study, participants were provided a Fitbit, responded to weekly symptom and physical function digital surveys, and met with a health coach weekly to develop and monitor goals. Coaching notes were discussed in weekly interdisciplinary team meetings and provided back to the treating oncology team. Symptom alerts were monitored and triaged through a study resource nurse to relevant supportive care services. Feasibility was determined based on intervention enrollment and completion. Acceptability was based on satisfaction with coaching and Fitbit-wearing and was informed by semistructured exit interviews. Outcomes evaluated for signs of improvement included several PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) measures, including the primary intervention target, physical function.<h4>Results</h4>From May 2020 to March 2022, 50 participants completed the single-arm pilot. Feasibility was high: 66% enrolled and 71% completed the full intervention. Participants reported an average of 4.8 and 4.7 (out of 5) on the acceptability of coaching calls and using the Fitbit, respectively. Physical function scores rose 3.1 points (SE = 1.1) from baseline to 3 months, and 4.3 (SE = 1.0) from baseline to 6 months, above established minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Improvements above MCID were also evident in anxiety and depression, and smaller improvements were demonstrated for emotional support, social isolation, cognitive function, symptom burden, and self-efficacy.<h4>Discussion</h4>HealthScore shows feasibility, acceptability, and promising preliminary outcomes. Randomized studies are underway to determine the efficacy of preserving physical function in patients with advanced cancer.},

Research shows that bright light and dim light therapy may be an efficacious way to reduce symptoms of fatigue. Still, the feasibility, scalability, individual treatment effects and adverse event heterogeneity of these treatments are unknown.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The current study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of a series of personalised (N-of-1) interventions for virtual delivery of bright light therapy and dim light therapy versus usual care treatment for fatigue in 60 participants. We hypothesise that this study will provide valuable information about implementing virtual, N-of-1 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for fatigue. It will also offer results about determining participants' ratings of usability and satisfaction with the virtual, personalised intervention delivery system; evaluating participants' improvement of fatigue symptoms; and, in the long term, identify ways to integrate N-of-1 light therapy trials into patient care.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This trial was approved by the Northwell Health Institutional Review Board. The trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. All publications resulting from this series of personalised trials will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension for N-of-1 trials CENT 2015 reporting guidelines.<h4>Registration details</h4>This trial is registered in www.<h4>Clinicaltrials</h4>gov (number NCT04707846).<h4>Trial registration number</h4>NCT04707846.},

In addition, we assessed the performance of the model for two subgroups (high and moderately consistent wearable device users). Study variables were derived from the electronic health records, questionnaires, and wearable devices of a cohort of individuals with one of 8 surgery types and that were part of the NIH All of Us research program. Through multivariable analysis, high frailty index (OR 1.69, 95% 1.05-7.22, p<0.006), and older age (OR 1.76, 95% 1.55-4.08, p<0.024) were found to be the driving risk factors of poor recovery post-surgery. Our logistic regression model included 15 variables, 5 of which included wearable device data. In wearable use subgroups, the model had better accuracy for high wearable users (81%). Findings demonstrate the potential for models that use wearable measures to assess frailty to inform clinicians of patients at risk for poor surgical outcomes. Our model performed with high accuracy across multiple surgery types and were robust to variable consistency in wearable use.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>While Fitbit<sup>®</sup> devices were initially intended for leisurely, consumer use, there has been recent interest among scientific and medical communities in the prospective use of Fitbit devices for clinical and research purposes. Those who have chronic health conditions are often required to spend considerable amounts of money and time undergoing physiological tests and activity monitoring to support, stabilize, and manage their health. This disease burden is only amplified in pediatric populations. Devices that are used to collect these data can be invasive, uncomfortable, and disconcerting. Using the Fitbit tracker to acquire such biometric data could ease this burden. Our scoping review seeks to summarize the research that has been conducted on the utilization of Fitbit devices in studies of children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and the feasibility, accuracy, and potential benefits of doing so.<h4>Methods</h4>Searches were conducted on PubMed for articles relating pediatric health to Fitbit device usage (using a Boolean search strategy). The eligibility criteria included trials being clinical and/or randomized controlled and articles being in English. Once articles were obtained, they underwent screening and exclusion processes and were charted for their titles, authors, objectives, results, and respective chronic illnesses. In the subsequent full-text review, further charting was conducted, collecting study designs, Fitbit parameters, feasibility, accuracy, and related health and clinical outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Fitbit trackers were unanimously demonstrated to be feasible devices in this population for physical activity monitoring and were determined to be potentially beneficial in measuring and improving overall wellbeing and physical health in children with chronic illness. Nevertheless, sufficient evidence was not found in support of Fitbit accuracy. Additional biases were identified against the population of children with chronic health conditions that may further enable inaccurate data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While Fitbit devices may be beneficial for those interested in improving physical health, discretion is advised for those seeking to collect accurate and/or medically necessitated data. Given the existing literature evaluated, medical-grade technologies are preferred in instances of the latter, as Fitbit devices have not been found to provide reliably accurate data.},

Results supported the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, as demonstrated by participant retention (85% at 4 months and 78% at 8 months), Smart Walk app use, and intervention satisfaction (i.e., 100% of PA participants completing the intervention [n = 24] reported they would recommend it to friend). Smart Walk participants also reported greater increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA (4-month between-arm difference in change [b] = 43.3 min/week; p = 0.018; Cohen’s d = 0.69; 8-month b = 56.6 min/week; p = 0.046; d = 0.63) and demonstrated clinically relevant, although not statistically significant (p-values > 0.05), baseline to 4 months improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (b = 1.67 mL/kg/min; d = 0.40), systolic blood pressure (b = −3.33 mmHg; d = 0.22), diastolic blood pressure (b = −4.28 mmHg; d = 0.37), and pulse wave velocity (b = −0.46 m/s; d = 0.33). Eight-month cardiometabolic outcomes followed similar trends, but had high rates of missing data (45−53%) due to COVID-19 restrictions. Collectively, findings demonstrated favorable outcomes for acceptability and feasibility, while also highlighting key areas for refinement in future research.},

Self-expansion is positively associated with health factors including self-reported physical activity (PA). This study is the first to investigate self-expansion and daily PA, and with a PA monitor. Fifty community participants completed baseline questionnaires, wore a Fitbit One and completed daily self-report questionnaires for 28 days, and completed follow-up questionnaires. Daily surveys included questions about both general and PA-specific self-expansion. Across the 4 weeks, steps taken was positively correlated with both general (all maximum likelihood r = 0.17) and PA-specific self-expansion (maximum likelihood rs of 0.15 and 0.16), and PA-specific self-expansion was positively correlated (maximum likelihood rs of 0.38 and 0.50) with aerobic activity. Future research should investigate this relationship in a larger more diverse sample and test whether PA-specific self-expansion can be utilized as an acceptable, feasible, and effective intervention to increase daily steps and other forms of PA.},

Participants: A total of 623 people with MDD wore a FitBit and completed regular outcome assessments via email for a median follow-up of 541 days. Multivariable regression models tested for associations between sleep features and depression outcomes. We considered two samples of people with at least one assessment of relapse (n=213) or at least one assessment of depression severity (n=390). <h4>Results:</h4> Increased intra-individual variability in total sleep time, greater sleep fragmentation, and later sleep mid-points were associated with worse depression outcomes. Adjusted Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs) suggested that an intervention to increase sleep consistency in adults with MDD could reduce the population risk for depression by up to 18-37%. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> We found consistent associations between wearable-derived sleep features and the probability of depressive relapse and increased depressive symptom severity. Disordered sleep is prevalent and disruptive, and challenging to capture longitudinally via conventional laboratory sleep assessments.

	Abstract = {Physical activity (PA) is associated with preserved age-related body and brain health. However, PA quantification can vary. Commercial-grade wearable monitors are objective, low burden tools to capture PA but are less well validated in older adults. Self-report PA questionnaires are widely accepted and more frequently used but carry inherent limitations. We aimed to compare these commonly used PA measures against one another and examine their convergent validity with a host of relevant outcomes. We also examined the factors that drive differences in PA self-reporting styles in older adults. 179 older adults completed 30-day Fitbit Flex2™ monitoring and reported PA levels <i>via</i> two widely used PA questionnaires: PASE and CHAMPS-METs (metabolic expenditure calories burned). Participants also completed measures of cardiometabolic (hypertension diagnosis, resting heart rate, A1C levels), cognitive (memory, processing speed, executive functioning), and brain MRI (medial temporal lobe volume) outcomes. The discrepancy between objective Fitbit monitoring and self-reported PA was evaluated using a sample-based z difference score. There were only modest relationships across all PA metrics. Fitbit step count demonstrated a stronger association with the PASE, whereas Fitbit calories burned was more strongly associated with CHAMPS-MET. Fitbit outcomes had more consistent convergence with relevant outcomes of interest (e.g., cardiometabolic and brain health indices) when compared to subjective measures; however, considerable heterogeneity within these associations was observed. A higher degree of overreporting was associated with worse memory and executive performances, as well as hypertension diagnoses. We build on prior findings that wearable, digital health indicators of PA demonstrate greater construct validity than self-report in older adults. We further show important clinical features (e.g., poorer cognitive status) of older adults that could contribute to a higher level of overreporting on self-report measures. Characterization of what PA measures truly operationalize will help elucidate relationships between most relevant facets of PA and outcomes of interest.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Many people do not regularly participate in physical activity, which may negatively impact their health. Current physical activity guidelines are focused on promoting weekly accumulation of at least 150 min of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Whilst revised guidance now recognises the importance of making small changes to physical activity behaviour, guidance still focuses on adults needing to achieve at least 150 min of MVPA per week. An alternative 'whole day' approach that could motivate the public to be more physically active, is a concept called Snacktivity™. Instead of focusing on achieving 150 min per week of physical activity, for example 30 min of MVPA over 5 days, Snacktivity™ encourages the public to achieve this through small, but frequent, 2-5 min 'snacks' of MVPA throughout the whole day.<h4>Methods</h4>The primary aim is to undertake a feasibility trial with nested qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Snacktivity™ intervention to inform the design of a subsequent phase III randomised trial. A two-arm randomised controlled feasibility trial aiming to recruit 80 inactive adults will be conducted. Recruitment will be from health and community settings and social media. Participants will be individually randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either the Snacktivity™ intervention or usual care. The intervention will last 12 weeks with assessment of outcomes completed before and after the intervention in all participants. We are interested in whether the Snacktivity™ trial is appealing to participants (assessed by the recruitment rate) and if the Snacktivity™ intervention and trial methods are acceptable to participants (assessed by Snacktivity™/physical activity adherence and retention rates). The intervention will be delivered by health care providers within health care consultations or by researchers. Participants' experiences of the trial and intervention, and health care providers' views of delivering the intervention within health consultations will be explored.<h4>Discussion</h4>The development of physical activity interventions that can be delivered at scale are needed. The findings from this study will inform the viability and design of a phase III trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Snacktivity™ to increase physical activity.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ISRCTN: 64851242.},

It affects up to one in seven people contracting the illness and causes a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, pain and brain fog. Many of these symptoms can be linked to dysautonomia or dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system after SARS-CoV2 infection. This study aims to test the feasibility and estimate the efficacy, of the heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-B) technique via a standardised slow diaphragmatic breathing programme in individuals with LC.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>30 adult LC patients with symptoms of palpitations or dizziness and an abnormal NASA Lean Test will be selected from a specialist Long COVID rehabilitation service. They will undergo a 4-week HRV-B intervention using a Polar chest strap device linked to the Elite HRV phone application while undertaking the breathing exercise technique for two 10 min periods everyday for at least 5 days a week. Quantitative data will be gathered during the study period using: HRV data from the chest strap and wrist-worn Fitbit, the modified COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale, Composite Autonomic Symptom Score, WHO Disability Assessment Schedule and EQ-5D-5L health-related quality of life measures. Qualitative feedback on user experience and feasibility of using the technology in a home setting will also be gathered. Standard statistical tests for correlation and significant difference will be used to analyse the quantitate data.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study has received ethical approval from Health Research Authority (HRA) Leicester South Research Ethics Committee (21/EM/0271).

In contrast, the use of wearable devices that monitor physical activity (PA) has been associated with changes in behavior in some studies. It is uncertain whether risk communication might enhance the effects of wearable devices. We aim to assess the effects on wearable-device-measured PA of communicating genetic risk for T2D alone or in combination with goal setting and activity prompts from a wearable device among overweight or obese East Asians. <h4>Methods: </h4>: In a parallel group, randomized controlled trial, a total of 355 overweight or obese East Asian individuals aged 40-60 years will be allocated into one of three groups: 1 control and 2 intervention groups. Blood samples will be used for estimation of T2D genetic risk and analysis of metabolic risk markers. Genetic risk of T2D will be estimated based on 113 SNPs associated with T2D among East Asians using an established method. All three groups will receive a Fitbit device. Both intervention groups will be given T2D genetic risk estimates along with lifestyle advice, but one of the intervention groups will additionally use Fitbit’s step-goal setting and prompt functions. Questionnaires and physical measurements will be administered at baseline, immediately after intervention delivery, and 6 and 12-month post-intervention following standard operating procedures. The primary outcome is time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA measured through the Fitbit. Secondary outcomes include other parameters of wearable-device-measured PA, sedentary time, and sleep, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, five intermediate metabolic risk markers, hand grip strength, self-reported PA, self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption and smoking status, and a list of psychological variables. <h4>Discussion: </h4> This study will be the first randomized controlled trial using the combination of communication of T2D genetic risk with standard functions of wearable devices in any population. Findings will inform strategies to prevent T2D through lifestyle modification.},

	Abstract = {Clinical performance status is designed to be a measure of overall health, reflecting a patient's physiological reserve and ability to tolerate various forms of therapy. Currently, it is measured by a combination of subjective clinician assessment and patient-reported exercise tolerance in the context of daily living activities. In this study, we assess the feasibility of combining objective data sources and patient-generated health data (PGHD) to improve the accuracy of performance status assessment during routine cancer care. Patients undergoing routine chemotherapy for solid tumors, routine chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) at one of four sites in a cancer clinical trials cooperative group were consented to a six-week prospective observational clinical trial (NCT02786628). Baseline data acquisition included cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and a six-minute walk test (6MWT). Weekly PGHD included patient-reported physical function and symptom burden. Continuous data capture included use of a Fitbit Charge HR (sensor). Baseline CPET and 6MWT could only be obtained in 68% of study patients, suggesting low feasibility during routine cancer treatment. In contrast, 84% of patients had usable fitness tracker data, 93% completed baseline patient-reported surveys, and overall, 73% of patients had overlapping sensor and survey data that could be used for modeling. A linear model with repeated measures was constructed to predict the patient-reported physical function. Sensor-derived daily activity, sensor-derived median heart rate, and patient-reported symptom burden emerged as strong predictors of physical function (marginal R2 0.429-0.433, conditional R2 0.816-0.822).

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Older adults who engage in physical activity can reduce their risk of mobility impairment and disability. Short amounts of walking can improve quality of life, physical function, and cardiovascular health. Various programs have been implemented to encourage older adults to engage in physical activity, but sustaining their motivation continues to be a challenge. Ubiquitous devices, such as mobile phones and smartwatches, coupled with machine-learning algorithms, can potentially encourage older adults to be more physically active. Current algorithms that are deployed in consumer devices (eg, Fitbit) are proprietary, often are not tailored to the movements of older adults, and have been shown to be inaccurate in clinical settings. Step-counting algorithms have been developed for smartwatches, but only using data from younger adults and, often, were only validated in controlled laboratory settings.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to develop and validate a smartwatch step-counting app for older adults and evaluate the algorithm in free-living settings over a long period of time.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed and evaluated a step-counting app for older adults on an open-source wrist-worn device (Amulet). The app includes algorithms to infer the level of physical activity and to count steps. We validated the step-counting algorithm in the lab (counting steps from a video recording, n=20) and in free-living conditions-one 2-day field study (n=6) and two 12-week field studies (using the Fitbit as ground truth, n=16). During app system development, we evaluated 4 walking patterns: normal, fast, up and down a staircase, and intermittent speed. For the field studies, we evaluated 5 different cut-off values for the algorithm, using correlation and error rate as the evaluation metrics.<h4>Results</h4>The step-counting algorithm performed well. In the lab study, for normal walking (R<sup>2</sup>=0.5), there was a stronger correlation between the Amulet steps and the video-validated steps; for all activities, the Amulet's count was on average 3.2 (2.1%) steps lower (SD 25.9) than the video-validated count. For the 2-day field study, the best parameter settings led to an association between Amulet and Fitbit (R<sup>2</sup>=0.989) and 3.1% (SD 25.1) steps lower than Fitbit, respectively. For the 12-week field study, the best parameter setting led to an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.669.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings demonstrate the importance of an iterative process in algorithm development before field-based deployment. This work highlights various challenges and insights involved in developing and validating monitoring systems in real-world settings. Nonetheless, our step-counting app for older adults had good performance relative to the ground truth (a commercial Fitbit step counter). Our app could potentially be used to help improve physical activity among older adults.},

However, the possible influence of sleep problems on glycemic variability has yet to be studied in depth. This study aims to assess the influence of sleep quality on glycemic control.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>An observational study of 25 adults with type 1 diabetes, with simultaneous recording, for 14 days, of continuous glucose monitoring (Abbott FreeStyle Libre system) and a sleep study by wrist actigraphy (Fitbit Ionic device). The study analyzes, using artificial intelligence techniques, the relationship between the quality and structure of sleep with time in normo-, hypo-, and hyperglycemia ranges and with glycemic variability. The patients were also studied as a group, comparing patients with good and poor sleep quality.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 243 days/nights were analyzed, of which 77% (<i>n</i> = 189) were categorized as poor quality and 33% (<i>n</i> = 54) as good quality. Linear regression methods were used to find a correlation (<i>r</i> =0.8) between the variability of sleep efficiency and the variability of mean blood glucose. With clustering techniques, patients were grouped according to their sleep structure (characterizing this structure by the number of transitions between the different sleep phases). These clusters showed a relationship between time in range and sleep structure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study suggests that poor sleep quality is associated with lower time in range and greater glycemic variability, so improving sleep quality in patients with type 1 diabetes could improve their glycemic control.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>For adults, vacations represent a break from daily responsibilities of work - offering the opportunity to re-distribute time between sleep, sedentary behaviour, light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) across the 24-h day. To date, there has been minimal research into how activity behaviour patterns change on vacation, and whether any changes linger after the vacation. This study examined how daily movement behaviours change from before, to during and after vacations, and whether these varied based on the type of vacation and vacation duration.<h4>Methods</h4>Data collected during the Annual Rhythms In Adults' lifestyle and health (ARIA) study were used. 308 adults (mean age 40.4 years, SD 5.6) wore Fitbit Charge 3 fitness trackers 24 h a day for 13 months. Minute-by-minute movement behaviour data were aggregated into daily totals. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regressions were used to compare movement behaviours during and post-vacation (4 weeks) to pre-vacation levels (14 days), and to examine the associations with vacation type and duration.<h4>Results</h4>Participants took an average of 2.6 (SD = 1.7) vacations of 12 (SD = 14) days' (N = 9778 days) duration. The most common vacation type was outdoor recreation (35%) followed by family/social events (31%), rest (17%) and non-leisure (17%). Daily sleep, LPA and MVPA all increased (+ 21 min [95% CI = 19,24] p < 0.001, + 3 min [95% CI = 0.4,5] p < 0.02, and + 5 min [95% CI = 3,6] p < 0.001 respectively) and sedentary behaviour decreased (-29 min [95% CI = -32,-25] p < 0.001) during vacation. Post-vacation, sleep remained elevated for two weeks; MVPA returned to pre-vacation levels; and LPA and sedentary behaviour over-corrected, with LPA significantly lower for 4 weeks, and sedentary behaviour significantly higher for one week. The largest changes were seen for "rest" and "outdoor" vacations. The magnitude of changes was smallest for short vacations (< 3 days).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Vacations are associated with favourable changes in daily movement behaviours. These data provide preliminary evidence of the health benefits of vacations.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The study was prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (Trial ID: ACTRN12619001430123).},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Weather is a potentially important influence on how time is allocated to sleep, sedentary behaviour and physical activity across the 24-h day. Extremes of weather (very hot, cold, windy or wet) can create undesirable, unsafe outdoor environments for exercise or active transport, impact the comfort of sleeping environments, and increase time indoors. This 13-month prospective cohort study explored associations between weather and 24-h movement behaviour patterns.<h4>Methods</h4>Three hundred sixty-eight adults (mean age 40.2 years, SD 5.9, 56.8% female) from Adelaide, Australia, wore Fitbit Charge 3 activity trackers 24 h a day for 13 months with minute-by-minute data on sleep, sedentary behaviour, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) collected remotely. Daily weather data included temperature, rainfall, wind, cloud and sunshine. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analyses (one model per outcome) were used.<h4>Results</h4>Ninety thousand eight hundred one days of data were analysed. Sleep was negatively associated with minimum temperature (-12 min/day change across minimum temperature range of 31.2 °C, p = 0.001). Sedentary behaviour was positively associated with minimum temperature (+ 12 min/day, range = 31.2 oC, p = 0.006) and wind speed (+ 10 min/day, range = 36.7 km/h, p< 0.001), and negatively associated with sunshine (-17 min/day, range = 13.9 h, p < 0.001). LPA was positively associated with minimum temperature (+ 11 min/day, range = 31.2 °C, p = 0.002), cloud cover (+ 4 min/day, range = 8 eighths, p = 0.008) and sunshine (+ 17 min/day, range = 13.9 h, p < 0.001), and negatively associated with wind speed (-8 min/day, range = 36.7 km/h, p < 0.001). MVPA was positively associated with sunshine (+ 3 min/day, range = 13.9 h, p < 0.001) and negatively associated with minimum temperature (-13 min/day, range = 31.2 oC, p < 0.001), rainfall (-3 min/day, range = 33.2 mm, p = 0.006) and wind speed (-4 min/day, range = 36.7 km/h, p < 0.001). For maximum temperature, a significant (p < 0.05) curvilinear association was observed with sleep (half-U) and physical activity (inverted-U), where the decrease in sleep duration appeared to slow around 23 °C, LPA peaked at 31 oC and MVPA at 27 °C.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Generally, adults tended to be less active and more sedentary during extremes of weather and sleep less as temperatures rise. These findings have the potential to inform the timing and content of positive movement behaviour messaging and interventions.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The study was prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (Trial ID: ACTRN12619001430123).},

The study population consisted of persons with CRC between 18- and 75 years of age who were able to use a smartphone or tablet and scheduled for elective surgery with curative intent. Excluded were persons not proficient in Dutch or following a protein-restricted diet. Participants used an activity tracker (Fitbit Charge 3) from 4 weeks before until 6 weeks after surgery. In the week before surgery (preoperative) and the fifth week after surgery (postoperative), participants also used a food record for 1 week. They shared their experience regarding usability (system usability scale, range 0-100) and acceptability (net promoter score, range -100 to +100).<h4>Results</h4>In total, 28 persons were included (n=16, 57% male, mean age 61, SD 8 years), and 27 shared their experiences. Scores regarding the activity tracker were as follows: preoperative median system usability score, 85 (IQR 73-90); net promoter score, +65; postoperative median system usability score, 78 (IQR 68-85); net promotor score, +67.

Participants were asked to wear a PA tracker for 3 months; during the same 3-month period, the Paediatric Asthma Diary (PAD) was administered daily and the Asthma Control (AC) Questionnaire together with the mini-Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life (AQoL) Questionnaire administered at weekly intervals.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with the pre-lockdown period, there was a significant reduction in PA levels after the lockdown began. Daily total steps reduced by about 3000 steps (<i>p</i> < 0.001), very active minutes by 9 min (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and fairly active minutes almost halved (<i>p</i> < 0.001); while asthma symptom control marginally improved, with the AC and AQoL score improving by 0.56 (<i>p</i> < 0.005) and 0.47 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), respectively. Further, for those with AC score higher than 1, PA was positively associated with asthma control both before and after the lockdown.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This feasibility study suggests that PA engagement of children with asthma is negatively affected during the pandemic, but the beneficial effect of PA on asthma symptom control potentially sustains even during a lockdown period. These findings emphasize the importance of wearable device to monitor longitudinal PA and thus better management of PA for achieving the best outcome of asthma symptom control.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction/purpose</h4>Physical activity studies often utilize wearable devices to measure participants' habitual activity levels by averaging values across several valid observation days. These studies face competing demands-available resources and the burden to study participants must be balanced with the goal to obtain reliable measurements of a person's longer-term average. Information about the number of valid observation days required to reliably measure targeted metrics of habitual activity is required to inform study design.<h4>Methods</h4>To date, the number of days required to achieve a desired level of aggregate long-term reliability (typically 0.80) has often been estimated by applying the Spearman-Brown Prophecy formula to short-term test-retest reliability data from studies with single, relatively brief observation windows. Our work, in contrast, utilizes a resampling-based approach to quantify the long-term test-retest reliability of aggregate measures of activity in a cohort of 79 participants who were asked to wear a FitBit Flex every day for approximately one year.<h4>Results</h4>The conventional approach can produce reliability estimates that substantially overestimate the actual test-retest reliability. Six or more valid days of observation for each participant appear necessary to obtain 0.80 reliability for the average amount of time spent in light physical activity; 8 and 10 valid days are needed for sedentary time and moderate/vigorous activity respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Protocols that result in 7-10 valid observation days for each participant may be needed to obtain reliable measurements of key physical activity metrics.},

Higher quality evidence is necessary, with larger sample sizes and more objective stratification of participants by skin tone, in order to characterize potential racial bias in consumer devices.},

All participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. ActivPAL data indicated statistically significant increases in daily steps (+ 1715.8 steps/day, Cohen's d = 0.97), stepping time (+ 1.9%, d = 0.75), standing time (+ 2.3%, d = 0.29), and decreases in total sedentary time (- 4.2%, d = 0.43) and sedentary bouts of 30 minutes (- 4.1%, d = 0.36) from baseline to the end of the second trimester, all p < 0.05. Decreases were also observed in sedentary bouts of 60 minutes (- 3.9%, d = 0.40), but this was not statistically significant.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The INSPiRE study demonstrated feasibility, high acceptability, and preliminary efficacy for improving movement behaviors in women during pregnancy, supporting future testing in a randomized controlled trial.},

The accuracy of the Fitbit model Charge 3 has not yet been examined.<h4>Aims</h4>To compare the Fitbit Charge 3 against the research-grade accelerometer ActiGraph GT3X-BT in measuring average daily steps and minutes spent in different PA intensities.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-four young PWH wore a wrist-worn Fitbit Charge 3 and hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X-BT simultaneously for seven consecutive days in free-living conditions. Correlation of and differences between the devices for daily averages of PA parameters were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and paired t-test, respectively. Agreement between devices was assessed using Bland-Altman plots.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty participants (mean age 21.8) were included in the analyses. We found moderate to high correlations between Fitbit and ActiGraph measured daily averages for all PA variables, but statistically significant differences between devices for all variables except daily minutes of moderate PA. Fitbit overestimated average daily steps, minutes of light, vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous PA. Bland-Altman plots showed a measurement bias between devices for all parameters with increasing overestimation by the Fitbit for higher volumes of PA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Fitbit Charge 3 overestimated steps and minutes of light, moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA as compared to the ActiGraph GT3X-BT, and this bias increased with PA volume. The Fitbit should therefore be used with caution in research, and we advise users of the device to be cognizant of this overestimation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Midlife women with menopausal symptoms are less likely to meet the recommended level of physical activity (PA). Promoting PA among women in midlife could reduce their risk of cardiovascular diseases and perhaps improve menopausal symptoms. Mobile PA interventions in the form of smartphone apps and wearable activity trackers can potentially encourage users to increase PA levels and address time and resource barriers to PA. However, evidence on the acceptability and effectiveness of these interventions among midlife women is unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness, acceptability, and active behavior change techniques (BCTs) of mobile PA technologies among midlife menopausal women.<h4>Methods</h4>A mixed methods systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies was conducted. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and the ProQuest Sports Medicine and Education Index were systematically searched. Studies were selected and screened according to predetermined eligibility criteria. In total, 2 reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and completed BCT mapping of the included interventions using the BCT Taxonomy v1.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 12 studies were included in this review. Overall risk of bias was "Moderate to high" in 58% (7/12) of the included studies and "low" in 42% (5/12) of the studies. Of the 12 studies, 7 (58%) assessed changes in PA levels. The pooled effect size of 2 randomized controlled trials resulted in a small to moderate increase in moderate to vigorous PA of approximately 61.36 weekly minutes among midlife women, at least in the short term (95% CI 17.70-105.01; P=.006). Although a meta-analysis was not feasible because of heterogeneity, positive improvements were also found in a range of menopause-related outcomes such as weight reduction, anxiety management, sleep quality, and menopause-related quality of life. Midlife women perceived mobile PA interventions to be acceptable and potentially helpful in increasing PA and daily steps. The average number of BCTs per mobile PA intervention was 8.8 (range 4-13) according to the BCT Taxonomy v1. "Self-monitoring of behaviour," "Biofeedback," and "Goal setting (behaviour)" were the most frequently described BCTs across the included interventions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review demonstrated that mobile PA interventions in the form of smartphone apps and wearable trackers are potentially effective for small to moderate increases in moderate to vigorous PA among midlife women with menopausal symptoms. Although menopause is a natural condition affecting half the population worldwide, there is a substantial lack of evidence to support the acceptability and effectiveness of mobile PA interventions on menopause-related outcomes, which needs further investigation.<h4>Trial registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD42021273062; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=273062.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Context</h4>There are research-grade devices that have been validated to measure either heart rate (HR) by electrocardiography (ECG) with a Polar chest strap, or step count with ACTiGraph accelerometer. However, wearable activity trackers that measure HR and steps concurrently have been tested against research-grade accelerometers and HR monitors with conflicting results. This review examines validation studies of the Fitbit Charge 2 (FBC2) for accuracy in measuring HR and step count and evaluates the device's reliability for use by researchers and clinicians.<h4>Design</h4>This registered review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The robvis (risk-of-bias visualization) tool was used to assess the strength of each considered article.<h4>Eligibility criteria</h4>Eligible articles published between 2018 and 2019 were identified using PubMed, CINHAL, Embase, Cochran, and World of Science databases and hand-searches. All articles were HR and/or step count validation studies for the FBC2 in adult ambulatory populations.<h4>Study selection</h4>Eight articles were examined in accordance with the eligibility criteria alignment and agreement among the authors and research librarian.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) were used to measure agreement between the tracker and criterion devices. Mean absolute percent error (MAPE) was used to average the individual absolute percent errors.<h4>Results</h4>Studies that measured CCC found agreement between the FBC2 and criterion devices ranged between 26% and 92% for HR monitoring, decreasing in accuracy as exercise intensity increased. Inversely, CCC increased from 38% to 99% for step count when exercise intensity increased. HR error between MAPE was 9.21% to 68% and showed more error as exercise intensity increased. Step measurement error MAPE was 12% for healthy persons aged 24-72 years but was reported at 46% in an older population with heart failure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Relative agreement with criterion and low-to-moderate MAPE were consistent in most studies reviewed and support validation of the FBC2 to accurately measure HR at low or moderate exercise intensities. However, more investigation controlling testing and measurement congruency is needed to validate step capabilities. The literature supports the validity of the FBC2 to accurately monitor HR, but for step count is inconclusive so the device may not be suitable for recommended use in all populations.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Remote measurement technologies (RMTs) such as smartphones and wearables can help improve treatment for depression by providing objective, continuous, and ecologically valid insights into mood and behavior. Engagement with RMTs is varied and highly context dependent; however, few studies have investigated their feasibility in the context of treatment.<h4>Objective</h4>A mixed methods design was used to evaluate engagement with active and passive data collection via RMT in people with depression undergoing psychotherapy. We evaluated the effects of treatment on 2 different types of engagement: study attrition (engagement with study protocol) and patterns of missing data (engagement with digital devices), which we termed data availability. Qualitative interviews were conducted to help interpret the differences in engagement.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 66 people undergoing psychological therapy for depression were followed up for 7 months. Active data were gathered from weekly questionnaires and speech and cognitive tasks, and passive data were gathered from smartphone sensors and a Fitbit (Fitbit Inc) wearable device.<h4>Results</h4>The overall retention rate was 60%. Higher-intensity treatment (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=4.6; P=.03) and higher baseline anxiety (t<sub>56.28</sub>=-2.80, 2-tailed; P=.007) were associated with attrition, but depression severity was not (t<sub>50.4</sub>=-0.18; P=.86). A trend toward significance was found for the association between longer treatments and increased attrition (U=339.5; P=.05). Data availability was higher for active data than for passive data initially but declined at a sharper rate (90%-30% drop in 7 months). As for passive data, wearable data availability fell from a maximum of 80% to 45% at 7 months but showed higher overall data availability than smartphone-based data, which remained stable at the range of 20%-40% throughout. Missing data were more prevalent among GPS location data, followed by among Bluetooth data, then among accelerometry data. As for active data, speech and cognitive tasks had lower completion rates than clinical questionnaires. The participants in treatment provided less Fitbit data but more active data than those on the waiting list.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Different data streams showed varied patterns of missing data, despite being gathered from the same device. Longer and more complex treatments and clinical characteristics such as higher baseline anxiety may reduce long-term engagement with RMTs, and different devices may show opposite patterns of missingness during treatment. This has implications for the scalability and uptake of RMTs in health care settings, the generalizability and accuracy of the data collected by these methods, feature construction, and the appropriateness of RMT use in the long term.},

	Abstract = {Physical activity can improve function in patients with chronic pain, however, adherence is low, in part due to inconsistent activity patterns. Smart wearable activity trackers, such as Fitbits, may help promote activity. In our program for chronic pain, we examined: 1) Fitbit activity patterns (ie, step count, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behavior), and 2) whether achievement of weekly, individualized Fitbit step goals was associated with functional outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis of Fitbit data from our 10-week mind-body activity program for chronic pain (GetActive-Fitbit arm, N = 41). Participants self-reported emotional and physical function and completed performance-based and accelerometer-based assessments. From week 1 to week 10, 30% of participants increased >800 steps; 32.5% increased MVPA; and 30% decreased sedentary behavior. Only step count significantly changed across time with mean steps peaking at week 8 (M = +1897.60, SD = 467.67). Fitbit step goal achievement was associated with improvements in anxiety (ß = -.35, CI [-2.80, -.43]), self-reported physical function (ß = -.34, CI [-5.17, 8.05]), and performance-based physical function (ß = .29, CI [-71.93, 28.38]), but not accelerometer-based physical function or depression. Adhering to individualized Fitbit step goals in the context of a mind-body activity program may improve anxiety and self-reported and performance-based physical function. PERSPECTIVE: We examine Fitbit activity patterns and the association between quota-based pacing and functional outcomes within a mind-body activity program for adults with chronic pain. Complementing quota-based pacing and coping skills with Fitbits may be a useful approach to promote activity engagement and behavior change in chronic pain populations.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disease with no validated specific and sensitive biomarker, and no standard approved treatment. In this observational study with no intervention, participants used a Fitbit activity tracker. The aims were to explore natural symptom variation, feasibility of continuous activity monitoring, and to compare activity data with patient reported outcome measures (PROMs).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this pilot study, 27 patients with mild to severe ME/CFS, of mean age 42.3 years, used the Fitbit Charge 3 continuously for six months. Patients wore a SenseWear activity bracelet for 7 days at baseline, at 3 and 6 months. At baseline and follow-up they completed the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-Short Form (DSQ-SF).<h4>Results</h4>The mean number of steps per day decreased with increasing ME/CFS severity; mild 5566, moderate 4991 and severe 1998. The day-by-day variation was mean 47% (range 25%-79%). Mean steps per day increased from the first to the second three-month period, 4341 vs 4781 steps, p = 0.022. The maximum differences in outcome measures between 4-week periods (highest vs lowest), were more evident in a group of eight patients with milder disease (baseline SF-36 PF > 50 or DSQ-SF < 55) as compared to 19 patients with higher symptom burden (SF-36 PF < 50 and DSQ-SF > 55), for SF-36 PF raw scores: 16.9 vs 3.4 points, and for steps per day: 958 versus 479 steps. The correlations between steps per day and self-reported SF-36 Physical function, SF-36 Social function, and DSQ-SF were significant. Fitbit recorded significantly higher number of steps than SenseWear. Resting heart rates were stable during six months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Continuous activity registration with Fitbit Charge 3 trackers is feasible and useful in studies with ME/CFS patients to monitor steps and resting heart rate, in addition to self-reported outcome measures.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04195815.},

This statistical learning approach is a natural extension of traditional statistical methods and can offer potential advantages for certain problems. The feasibility of using machine learning techniques in health care is predicated on access to a sufficient volume of data in a problem space.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the feasibility of data collection from an adolescent population before and after a posterior spine fusion operation.<h4>Methods</h4>Both physical and psychosocial data were collected. Adolescents scheduled for a posterior spine fusion operation were approached when they were scheduled for the surgery. The study collected repeated measures of patient data, including at least 2 weeks prior to the operation and 6 months after the patients were discharged from the hospital. Patients were provided with a Fitbit Charge 4 (consumer-grade health tracker) and instructed to wear it as often as possible. A third-party web-based portal was used to collect and store the Fitbit data, and patients were trained on how to download and sync their personal device data on step counts, sleep time, and heart rate onto the web-based portal. Demographic and physiologic data recorded in the electronic medical record were retrieved from the hospital data warehouse. We evaluated changes in the patients' psychological profile over time using several validated questionnaires (ie, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). Questionnaires were administered to patients using Qualtrics software. Patients received the questionnaire prior to and during the hospitalization and again at 3 and 6 months postsurgery. We administered paper-based questionnaires for the self-report of daily pain scores and the use of analgesic medications.<h4>Results</h4>There were several challenges to data collection from the study population. Only 38% (32/84) of the patients we approached met eligibility criteria, and 50% (16/32) of the enrolled patients dropped out during the follow-up period-on average 17.6 weeks into the study. Of those who completed the study, 69% (9/13) reliably wore the Fitbit and downloaded data into the web-based portal. These patients also had a high response rate to the psychosocial surveys. However, none of the patients who finished the study completed the paper-based pain diary. There were no difficulties accessing the demographic and clinical data stored in the hospital data warehouse.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identifies several challenges to long-term medical follow-up in adolescents, including willingness to participate in these types of studies and compliance with the various data collection approaches. Several of these challenges-insufficient incentives and personal contact between researchers and patients-should be addressed in future studies.},

The criterion measure was directly observed steps. Computed validity indices included accuracy (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE), bias (mean percentage error, MPE), and precision (correlation coefficient, r; standard deviation, SD; coefficient of variation, CoV).<h4>Results</h4>Over the range of normal speeds, 15 devices (Actical, waist-worn ActiGraph GT9X, activPAL, Apple Watch Series 1, Fitbit Ionic, Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip, Garmin vivoactive 3, Garmin vivofit 3, waist-worn GENEActiv, NL-1000, PiezoRx, Samsung Gear Fit2, Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro, and StepWatch) performed at < 5% MAPE. The wrist-worn ActiGraph GT9X displayed the worst accuracy across normal speeds (MAPE = 52%). On average, accuracy was compromised across slow walking speeds for all wearable technologies (MAPE = 40%) while all performed best across normal speeds (MAPE = 7%). When analyzing the data by wear locations, the ankle and thigh demonstrated the best accuracy (both MAPE = 1%), followed by the waist (3%) and the wrist (15%) across normal speeds. There were significant effects of speed, wear location, and age group on accuracy and bias (both p < 0.001) and precision (p ≤ 0.045).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Standardized validation indices cataloged by speed, wear location, and age group across the adult lifespan facilitate selecting, evaluating, or comparing performance of step counting wearable technologies. Speed, wear location, and age displayed a significant effect on accuracy, bias, and precision. Overall, reduced performance was associated with very slow walking speeds (0.8 to 3.2 km/h). Ankle- and thigh-located devices logged the highest accuracy, while those located at the wrist reported the worst accuracy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02650258.

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>There has been a rapid increase in the use of commercially available activity trackers, such as Fitbit, in physical activity intervention research. However, little is known about the long-term sustained use of trackers and behavior change after short-term interventions.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to use minute-level data collected from a Fitbit tracker for up to 2 years after the end of a randomized controlled trial to examine patterns of Fitbit use and activity over time.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants in this secondary data analysis were 75 female breast cancer survivors who had been enrolled in a 12-week physical activity randomized controlled trial. Participants randomized to the exercise intervention (full intervention arm) received a Fitbit One, which was worn daily throughout the 12-week intervention, and then were followed for 2 years after the intervention. Participants randomized to the waitlist arm, after completing the randomized controlled trial, received a Fitbit One and a minimal version of the exercise intervention (light intervention arm), and then were followed for 2 years after the intervention. Average and daily adherence and MVPA were compared between the 2 groups in the interventional and postinterventional periods using both linear and generalized additive mixed effects models.<h4>Results</h4>Adherence to wearing the Fitbit during the 12-week intervention period was significantly higher in the full intervention arm than in the light intervention arm (85% vs 60%; P<.001). Average adherence was significantly lower for both study arms during the follow-up period than in the intervention period; however, there were statistically different patterns of adherence during the follow-up period, with the light intervention arm having steeper declines than the full intervention arm over time (P<.001). Similar to the adherence results, mean minutes of Fitbit-measured MVPA was higher for the full intervention arm than for the light intervention arm during the 12-week intervention period (mean MVPA 27.89 minutes/day, SD 16.38 minutes/day vs 18.35 minutes/day, SD 12.64 minutes/day; P<.001). During the follow-up period, average MVPA was significantly lower than the 12-week intervention period for both the full intervention arm (21.74 minutes/day, SD 24.65 minutes/day; P=.002) and the light intervention arm (15.03 minutes/day, SD 13.27 minutes/day; P=.004). Although the mean MVPA in each arm was similar across the follow-up period (P=.33), the pattern of daily MVPA was significantly different between the 2 groups (P<.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>While adherence to wearing activity trackers and maintaining physical activities declined after completion of a 12-week exercise intervention, a more active interventional strategy resulted in greater wear time and activity levels during the intervention and more stable patterns of adherence and activity in the long term. An improved understanding of long-term maintenance patterns may inform improved exercise interventions that result in sustained increases in physical activity.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02332876; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02332876.},

The laborer's work shifts can affect personal life and sleep standards, adversely impacting laborers and their manage. This study assesses the impact of various shift plans (seven evenings/7 days, fixed-night or fixed-day, and backup shifts) on shift laborers, considering four shift schedules. Most laborers were on rotational shifts, whereas others were on a permanent day, permanent night, and standby shifts. In a cross-sectional study, 45 development laborers from the National Construction firm were enlisted. Bio-wearable sensors were provided to monitor sleep. Participants were approached and asked to complete a survey bundle comprising the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Differences in sleep models were estimated using a Fitbit watch at various shift schedules. The average age of laborers who participated in the study was 37.5 years, and their average experience in the construction company was 6.5 years. The average total sleep time was 346 ± 46 min. The rotational shift laborers yielded the minimum total sleep time compared to the average PSQI and ESS scores of 7.66 ± 1.3 and 6.94 ± 3.4, respectively. Fifteen shift laborers (33.33%) were affected by a sleeping disorder in the present experimental investigation, and 30 participants had inadequate standards of sleep based on the PSQI scores. Poor sleep quality and duration among construction shift laborers decrease productivity at work. Additional studies are expected to assess sleep-related issues affecting construction shift laborers.},

	Abstract = {Regular physical activity reduces the progression of several cancers and offers physical and mental health benefits for cancer survivors. However, many cancer survivors are not sufficiently active to achieve these health benefits. Possible biological mechanisms through which physical activity could affect cancer progression include reduced systemic inflammation and positive changes in metabolic markers. Chronic and acute hyperglycemia could have downstream effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. One novel strategy to motivate cancer survivors to be more active is to provide personalized biological-based feedback that demonstrates the immediate positive impact of physical activity. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have been used to demonstrate the acute beneficial effects of physical activity on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolisms in controlled lab settings. Using personal data from CGMs to illustrate the immediate impact of physical activity on glucose patterns could be particularly relevant for cancer survivors because they are at a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). As a pilot project, this study aims to (1) test the preliminary effect of a remotely delivered physical activity intervention that incorporates personalized biological-based feedback on daily physical activity levels, and (2) explore the association between daily glucose patterns and cancer-related insulin pathway and inflammatory biomarkers in cancer survivors who are at high risk for T2D. We will recruit 50 insufficiently active, post-treatment cancer survivors who are at elevated risk for T2D. Participants will be randomly assigned into (1) a group that receives personalized biological feedback related to physical activity behaviors; and (2) a control group that receives standard educational material. The feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this wearable sensor-based, biofeedback-enhanced 12-week physical activity intervention will be evaluated. Data from this study will support the further refinement and enhancement of a more comprehensive remotely delivered physical activity intervention that targets cancer survivors.

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>eHealth technologies offer an efficient method to integrate park prescriptions into clinical practice by primary health care (PHC) providers to help patients improve their health <i>via</i> tailored, nature-based health behavior interventions. This paper describes the protocol of the GoalRx Prescription Intervention (GPI) which was designed to leverage community resources to provide tailored park prescriptions for PHC patients.<h4>Methods</h4>The GPI study was designed as a 3-arm, multi-site observational study. We enrolled low-income, rural adults either at-risk of or living with hypertension or diabetes (<i>n</i> = 75) from Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) in two counties in North Carolina, USA into the 3-month intervention. Eligible participants self-selected to receive (1) a tailored park prescription intervention; (2) a tailored home/indoor PA prescription intervention; or (3) a healthy eating prescription (with no PA prescription beyond standard PA counseling advice that is already routinely provided in PHC) as the comparison group. The GPI app paired patient health data from the electronic health record with stated patient preferences and triggered app-integrated SMS motivation and compliance messaging directly to the patient. Patients were assessed at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up upon the completion of the intervention. The primary outcome (mean difference in weekly physical activity from baseline (T0) to post-intervention (T1) as measured by the Fitbit Flex 2) was assessed at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included assessment of the relationship between the intervention and biological markers of health, including body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c or available glucose test (if applicable), and a depression screen score using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Secondary outcomes also included the total number of SMS messages sent, number of SMS messages responded to, number of SMS messages ignored, and opt-out rate.<h4>Discussion</h4>The goal was to create a protocol utilizing eHealth technologies that addressed the specific needs of rural low-income communities and fit into the natural rhythms and processes of the selected FQHC clinics in North Carolina. This protocol offered a higher standard of health care by connecting patients to their PHC teams and increasing patient motivation to make longer-lasting health behavior changes.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in technology have led to an explosion of data in virtually all domains of our lives. Modern biomedical devices can acquire a large number of physical readings from patients. Often, these readings are stored in the form of time series data. Such time series data can form the basis for important research to advance healthcare and well being. Due to several considerations including data size, patient privacy, etc., the original, full data may not be available to secondary parties or researchers. Instead, suppose that a subset of the data is made available. A fast and reliable record linkage algorithm enables us to accurately match patient records in the original and subset databases while maintaining privacy. The problem of record linkage when the attributes include time series has not been studied much in the literature. We introduce two main contributions in this paper. First, we propose a novel, very efficient, and scalable record linkage algorithm that is employed on time series data. This algorithm is 400× faster than the previous work. Second, we introduce a privacy preserving framework that enables health institutions to safely release their raw time series records to researchers with bare minimum amount of identifying information.},

This randomized controlled trial assessed feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week moderate-intensity yoga intervention (3×/week, 50 min) delivered remotely (vs. a waitlist control arm), on stress and cognitive functioning. Participants (n = 86) were low active, full-time working adults (81.40% female; M<sub>age</sub> = 41 years) with symptoms of stress. Feasibility was assessed via adherence, enjoyment, and safety; stress and anxiety via self-report questionnaires; and executive functioning via neuropsychological tests. Overall attendance was 75.1%, 100% of participants enjoyed the intervention, and only one adverse event was reported. At follow-up, the yoga group had significantly lower stress and anxiety, and higher accuracy on working memory tasks. Remote moderate intensity yoga practice proved safe, enjoyable, and may reduce stress and improve cognitive functioning. This study was pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04740229).},

Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AF may differ between available smart devices, and this has not yet been adequately investigated.<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim was to assess the accuracy of 5 smart devices in identifying AF compared with a physician-interpreted 12-lead electrocardiogram as the reference standard in a real-world cohort of patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We consecutively enrolled patients presenting to a cardiology service at a tertiary referral center in a prospective, diagnostic study.<h4>Results</h4>We prospectively analyzed 201 patients (31% women, median age 66.7 years). AF was present in 62 (31%) patients. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AF were comparable between devices: 85% and 75% for the Apple Watch 6, 85% and 75% for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, 58% and 75% for the Withings Scanwatch, 66% and 79% for the Fitbit Sense, and 79% and 69% for the AliveCor KardiaMobile, respectively. The rate of inconclusive tracings (the algorithm was unable to determine the heart rhythm) was 18%, 17%, 24%, 21%, and 26% for the Apple Watch 6, Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, Withings Scan Watch, Fitbit Sense, and AliveCor KardiaMobile (P < 0.01 for pairwise comparison), respectively. By manual review of inconclusive tracings, the rhythm could be determined in 955 (99%) of 969 single-lead electrocardiograms. Regarding patient acceptance, the Apple Watch was ranked first (39% of participants).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this clinical validation of 5 direct-to-consumer smart devices, we found differences in the amount of inconclusive tracings diminishing sensitivity and specificity of the smart devices. In a clinical setting, manual review of tracings is required in about one-fourth of cases.},

Using the electronic health records data from the All of Us Research Program, we show that step count volumes as captured by participants' own Fitbit devices were associated with risk of chronic disease across the entire human phenome. Of the 6,042 participants included in the study, 73% were female, 84% were white and 71% had a college degree, and participants had a median age of 56.7 (interquartile range 41.5-67.6) years and body mass index of 28.1 (24.3-32.9) kg m<sup>-2</sup>. Participants walked a median of 7,731.3 (5,866.8-9,826.8) steps per day over the median activity monitoring period of 4.0 (2.2-5.6) years with a total of 5.9 million person-days of monitoring. The relationship between steps per day and incident disease was inverse and linear for obesity (n = 368), sleep apnea (n = 348), gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 432) and major depressive disorder (n = 467), with values above 8,200 daily steps associated with protection from incident disease. The relationships with incident diabetes (n = 156) and hypertension (n = 482) were nonlinear with no further risk reduction above 8,000-9,000 steps. Although validation in a more diverse sample is needed, these findings provide a real-world evidence-base for clinical guidance regarding activity levels that are necessary to reduce disease risk.},

As sleep is essential for well-being, health, and peak performance, the number of available consumer technologies to assess individual sleep behavior is increasing rapidly. However, little is known about the consumer wearables' usability and reliability for sleep tracking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the sleep measures of wearable devices with a standardized sleep diary in young healthy adults in free-living conditions. We tracked night sleep from 30 participants (19 females, 11 males; 24.3 ± 4.2 years old). Each wore three wearables and simultaneously assessed individual sleep patterns for four consecutive nights. Wearables and diaries correlated substantially regarding time in bed (Range CCC<sub>Lin</sub>: 0.74-0.84) and total sleep time (Range CCC<sub>Lin</sub>: 0.76-0.85). There was no sufficient agreement regarding the measures of sleep efficiency (Range CCC<sub>Lin</sub>: 0.05-0.34) and sleep interruptions (Range CCC<sub>Lin</sub>: -0.02-0.10). Finally, these results show wearables to be an easy-to-handle, time- and cost-efficient alternative to tracking sleep in healthy populations. Future research should develop and empirically test the usability of such consumer sleep technologies.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background: </h4> Physical activity (PA) levels might be a simple overall physical marker of recovery in acutely hospitalized older adults; however cut-off values post discharge are lacking. Our objective was to identify cut-off values for post-discharge PA that indicate recovery among acutely hospitalized older adults and stratified for frailty. <h4>Methods: </h4> We performed a prospective observational cohort study including acutely hospitalized older adults (≥70 years). Frailty was assessed using Fried’s criteria. PA was assessed using Fitbit up to one week post discharge and quantified in steps and minutes light, moderate or higher intensity. The primary outcome was recovery at 3-months post discharge. ROC-curve analyses were used to determine cut-off values, and logistic regression analyses to calculate odds ratios (ORs). <h4>Results: </h4> The analytic sample included 174 participants with a mean (standard deviation) age of 79.2 (6.7) years of whom 84/174 (48%) were frail. At 3-months, 109/174 participants (63%) had recovered of whom 48 were frail. In all participants, determined cut-off values were 1369 steps/day (OR: 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–4.6) and 76 minutes/day of light intensity PA (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.6–5.8). In frail participants, cut-off values were 1043 steps/day (OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.3–8.4) and 72 minutes/day of light intensity PA (OR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.6–10.8). Determined cut-off values were not significantly associated with recovery in non-frail participants. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Post-discharge PA cut-offs indicate the odds of recovery in older adults, especially in frail individuals, however are not equipped for use as a diagnostic test in daily practice. This is a first step in providing a direction for setting rehabilitation goals in older adults after hospitalization.},

Wearable technologies such as Fitbit® enable tracking of daily step counts. We assessed the psychometric properties of Fitbit® and compared the accuracy of Fitbit® step counts to ActiGraph®.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a pilot, proof of concept, prospective observational study with four visits at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months in PM, DM, necrotizing myopathy (NM) or anti-synthetase syndrome (AS) subjects. Six core set measures (manual muscle testing, physician global disease activity, patient global disease activity, and extra-muscular disease activity, HAQ-Disability Index and creatine kinase), three functional tests (six-min walk, timed up-and-go, sit-to-stand tests) and SF-36 physical function-10 (PF10) were collected at each visit. Patients wore waist-worn Fitbit® One and ActiGraph® T3X-BT concurrently for 7 days/month for 6 months.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-four (10 DM, 8 PM/NM, 6 AS) patients (17 females/7 males; 91% Caucasian) were enrolled. Test-retest reliability of daily steps was strong in 1-month follow-up (ICC 0.89). Daily steps and peak 1-min cadence showed moderate-strong correlations with physician global disease activity, patient global disease activity, HAQ-Disability Index, SF-36 PF10 and all three functional tests. Fitbit® and ActiGraph® step counts demonstrated good agreement and strong correlation (ICC 0.96).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Fitbit® daily steps and peak 1-min cadence are reliable and valid measures of physical activity in a cohort of myositis patients. This pilot data suggests that Fitbit® has a potential for use in clinical practice and trials to monitor physical activity in myositis patients, but larger studies are needed for further validation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Detailed self-monitoring (or tracking) of dietary intake is a popular and effective weight loss approach that can be delivered via digital tools, although engagement declines over time. Simplifying the experience of self-monitoring diet may counteract this decline in engagement. Testing these strategies among racial and ethnic minority groups is important as these groups are often disproportionately affected by obesity yet underrepresented in behavioral obesity treatment.<h4>Objective</h4>In this 2-arm pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a digital weight loss intervention with either detailed or simplified dietary self-monitoring.<h4>Methods</h4>We recruited racial and ethnic minority adults aged ≥21 years with a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and living in the United States. The Pacific time zone was selected for a fully remote study. Participants received a 3-month stand-alone digital weight loss intervention and were randomized 1:1 to either the detailed arm that was instructed to self-monitor all foods and drinks consumed each day using the Fitbit mobile app or to the simplified arm that was instructed to self-monitor only red zone foods (foods that are highly caloric and of limited nutritional value) each day via a web-based checklist. All participants were instructed to self-monitor both steps and body weight daily. Each week, participants were emailed behavioral lessons, action plans, and personalized feedback. In total, 12 a priori benchmarks were set to establish feasibility, including outcomes related to reach, retention, and self-monitoring engagement (assessed objectively via digital tools). Acceptability was assessed using a questionnaire. Weight change was assessed using scales shipped to the participants' homes and reported descriptively.<h4>Results</h4>The eligibility screen was completed by 248 individuals, of whom 38 (15.3%) were randomized, 18 to detailed and 20 to simplified. At baseline, participants had a mean age of 47.4 (SD 14.0) years and BMI of 31.2 (SD 4.8) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. More than half (22/38, 58%) were identified as Hispanic of any race. The study retention rate was 92% (35/38) at 3 months. The detailed arm met 9 of 12 feasibility benchmarks, while the simplified arm met all 12. Self-monitoring engagement was moderate to high (self-monitoring diet: median of 49% of days for detailed, 97% for simplified; self-monitoring steps: 99% for detailed, 100% for simplified; self-monitoring weight: 67% for detailed, 80% for simplified). Participants in both arms reported high satisfaction, with 89% indicating that they would recommend the intervention. Weight change was -3.4 (95% CI -4.6 to -2.2) kg for detailed and -3.3 (95% CI -4.4 to -2.2) kg for simplified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A digital weight loss intervention that incorporated either detailed or simplified dietary self-monitoring was feasible, with high retention and engagement, and acceptable to racial and ethnic minority adults.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ASPREDICTED #66674; https://aspredicted.org/ka478.pdf.},

Daily step counts were examined descriptively. Predictors of daily steps were explored across the full sample, then by diagnosis, using linear mixed-effects regression analyses.<h4>Results</h4>Forty participants (n=20 PD; n=20 stroke) were included in the analysis with a mean (SD) age of 72.9 (7.6) years. Participants resided 252.6 (105.6) miles from the coordinating site. Recruitment response rates were 11% (PD) and 6% (stroke). Study completion rates were 71% (PD) and 80% (stroke).

	Abstract = {Behavioral interventions delivered via one-on-one telephone coaching (hereafter referred to as telehealth) for weight loss have had great population-level reach but to date limited efficacy. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has promise to improve behavioral weight loss treatment efficacy by addressing the fundamental challenges of weight loss and maintenance: overeating in response to internal (e.g., stress) and external (e.g., high calorie foods) cues. Here we describe the Weight Loss, Nutrition, and Exercise Study (WeLNES) randomized controlled trial that is testing the efficacy of an ACT-based telehealth coaching intervention for weight loss in comparison to a Standard Behavioral Therapy (SBT)-based telehealth coaching intervention. A total of 398 adults with overweight or obesity are being recruited and randomized to either ACT or SBT telehealth coaching. Participants in both arms are offered twenty-five telehealth coaching sessions in year one and nine booster sessions in year two. All participants receive a Bluetooth-enabled scale to self-monitor weight and a Fitbit Inspire + Fitbit app for tracking diet and physical activity. The primary aim is to determine whether a greater proportion of ACT participants will achieve a clinically significant weight loss of ≥10% compared with SBT participants at 12-months. Secondary outcomes include change in weight from baseline to 6, 12, and 24-months. Whether the effect of ACT on weight loss is mediated by ACT processes and is moderated by baseline factors will also be examined. If ACT proves efficacious, ACT telehealth coaching will offer an effective, broadly scalable weight loss treatment-thereby making a high public health impact.},

	Abstract = {Fatigue is the most reported symptom in patients with sarcoidosis (SPs) and is a significant predictor of decreased quality of life that is strongly associated with stress and negative mood states. Few medications exist for treating fatigue in SPs, and outpatient physical rehabilitation programs are limited by availability and cost. Sarcoidosis in the US predominantly impacts minorities and underserved populations who are of working age and often have limited resources (e.g., financial, transportation, time off work) that may prevent them from attending in-person programs. The use of mobile health (mHealth) is emerging as a viable alternative to provide access to self-management resources to improve quality of life. The Sarcoidosis Patient Assessment and Resource Companion (SPARC) App is a sarcoidosis-specific mHealth App intended to improve fatigue and stress in SPs. It prompts SPs to conduct breathing awareness meditation (BAM) and contains educational modules aimed at improving self-efficacy. Herein we describe the design and methods of a 3-month randomized control trial comparing use of the SPARC App (10-min BAM twice daily) to standard care in 50 SPs with significant fatigue (FAS ≥22). A Fitbit® watch will provide immediate heartrate feedback after BAM sessions to objectively monitor adherence. The primary outcomes are feasibility and usability of the SPARC App (collected monthly). Secondary endpoints include preliminary efficacy at improving fatigue, stress, and quality of life. We expect the SPARC App to be a useable and feasible intervention that has potential to overcome barriers of more traditional in-person programs.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Smartwatches are a consumer wearable device offering a potential, practical, and affordable method to collect personal health data in healthy adults. For patients with chronic diseases, this would enable symptom monitoring and aid clinical decision making. Therefore, providing customized checklists to recommend smartwatches is beneficial. However, few studies have evaluated the practical functions of smartwatches and their influence on user acceptance. We aimed at developing a reliable tool to assess the quality of smartwatches from the users' perspective.<h4>Methods</h4>To develop the smartwatch rating scale (SWRS), we conducted a comprehensive literature review as well as reviewed relevant websites. The SWRS includes 22 items for the usability (usability, functionality, safety, material, and display) and five items for the acceptance and adoption domain (satisfaction and intention). We measured the scale's internal consistency and inter-rater reliability by evaluating seven smartwatches.<h4>Results</h4>The overall scale demonstrated an excellent level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91), with each subscale's internal consistency above good level (0.74 ~ 0.92). Inter-rater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) was at good level (2-way random ICC = 0.82, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.97).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SWRS is reliable, which can meet the need for assessment of smartwatch technology for utilizing in personal healthcare. Accounting for users' perspectives will help make the most of technology without impairing the human aspects of care, this study can help consumers choose a smartwatch based on their preferences and provide guidelines for developing user-friendly wearable devices aimed at health behavior changes.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Importance</h4>The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report identified important research gaps to inform future guidance for adolescents, including limited evidence on the importance of sedentary behaviors (screen time) and their interactions with physical activity for adolescent health outcomes, including overweight and obesity.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify the independent associations of physical activity and screen time categories, and the interactions between physical activity and screen time categories, with body mass index (BMI) and overweight and obesity in adolescents.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This cross-sectional study used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study collected from September 10, 2018, to September 29, 2020. Data were analyzed from July 8 to December 20, 2022. A total of 5797 adolescents aged 10 to 14 years from 21 racially and ethnically diverse study sites across the US were included in the analysis.<h4>Exposures</h4>Categories of total step count per day (with 1000 to 6000 steps per day indicating low, >6000 to 12 000 steps per day indicating medium, and >12 000 steps per day indicating high), as measured by a wearable digital device (Fitbit), and categories of self-reported screen time hours per day (with 0 to 4 hours per day indicating low, >4 to 8 hours per day indicating medium, and >8 hours per day indicating high).<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Participant BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared and converted into sex- and age-specific percentiles in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth curves and definitions. Individuals were classified as having overweight or obesity if their BMI was in the 85th percentile or higher for sex and age.<h4>Results</h4>Among 5797 adolescents included in the analytic sample, 50.4% were male, 61.0% were White, 35.0% had overweight or obesity, and the mean (SD) age was 12.0 (0.6) years. Mean (SD) reported screen time use was 6.5 (5.4) hours per day, and mean (SD) overall step count was 9246.6 (3111.3) steps per day. In models including both screen time and step count, medium (risk ratio [RR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12-1.37) and high (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.16-1.44) screen time categories were associated with higher overweight or obesity risk compared with the low screen time category. Medium (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.35) and low (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.51) step count categories were associated with higher overweight or obesity risk compared with the high step count category. Evidence of effect modification between screen time and step count was observed for BMI percentile. For instance, among adolescents with low screen use, medium step count was associated with a 1.55 higher BMI percentile, and low step count was associated with a 7.48 higher BMI percentile. However, among those with high screen use, step count categories did not significantly change the association with higher BMI percentile (low step count: 8.79 higher BMI percentile; medium step count: 8.76 higher BMI percentile; high step count: 8.26 higher BMI percentile).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>In this cross-sectional study, a combination of low screen time and high step count was associated with lower BMI percentile in adolescents. These results suggest that high step count may not offset higher overweight or obesity risk for adolescents with high screen time, and low screen time may not offset higher overweight or obesity risk for adolescents with low step count. These findings addressed several research gaps identified by the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report and may be used to inform future screen time and physical activity guidance for adolescents.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Physical activity is an integral part of healthy aging; yet, most adults aged ≥65 years are not sufficiently active. Preliminary evidence suggests that web-based interventions with computer-tailored advice and Fitbit activity trackers may be well suited for older adults.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of Active for Life, a 12-week web-based physical activity intervention with 6 web-based modules of computer-tailored advice to increase physical activity in older Australians.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants were recruited both through the web and offline and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 trial arms: tailoring+Fitbit, tailoring only, or a wait-list control. The computer-tailored advice was based on either participants' Fitbit data (tailoring+Fitbit participants) or self-reported physical activity (tailoring-only participants). The main outcome was change in wrist-worn accelerometer (ActiGraph GT9X)-measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) from baseline to after the intervention (week 12). The secondary outcomes were change in self-reported physical activity measured by means of the Active Australia Survey at the midintervention point (6 weeks), after the intervention (week 12), and at follow-up (week 24). Participants had a face-to-face meeting at baseline for a demonstration of the intervention and at baseline and week 12 to return the accelerometers. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were conducted with a γ distribution and log link to compare MVPA and self-reported physical activity changes over time within each trial arm and between each of the trial arms.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 243 participants were randomly assigned to tailoring+Fitbit (n=78, 32.1%), tailoring only (n=96, 39.5%), and wait-list control (n=69, 28.4%). Attrition was 28.8% (70/243) at 6 weeks, 31.7% (77/243) at 12 weeks, and 35.4% (86/243) at 24 weeks. No significant overall time by group interaction was observed for MVPA (P=.05). There were no significant within-group changes for MVPA over time in the tailoring+Fitbit group (+3%, 95% CI -24% to 40%) or the tailoring-only group (-4%, 95% CI -24% to 30%); however, a significant decline was seen in the control group (-35%, 95% CI -52% to -11%). The tailoring+Fitbit group participants increased their MVPA 59% (95% CI 6%-138%) more than those in the control group. A significant time by group interaction was observed for self-reported physical activity (P=.02). All groups increased their self-reported physical activity from baseline to week 6, week 12, and week 24, and this increase was greater in the tailoring+Fitbit group than in the control group at 6 weeks (+61%, 95% CI 11%-133%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A computer-tailored physical activity intervention with Fitbit integration resulted in improved MVPA outcomes in comparison with a control group in older adults.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618000646246; https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12618000646246.},

This prospective pilot study assesses the relationship between functional capacity by accelerometry and right ventricular measurements on echocardiography for this high-risk cohort.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with PAH were prospectively enrolled and underwent 6-Minute Walk Test and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. They were given a Fitbit, which collected steps and sedentary time per day. Echocardiographic data included right ventricular global longitudinal, free wall, and septal strain; tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion; tricuspid annular plane systolic velocity; right ventricular myocardial performance index; and pulmonary artery acceleration time. Pairwise correlations were performed.<h4>Results</h4>The final analysis included 22 patients aged 13 to 59 years. Tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity had a negative correlation with 6-Minute Walk Test (r = -0.58, P = .02), peak oxygen consumption on exercise testing (r = -0.56, P = .03), and average daily steps on accelerometry (r = -0.59, P = .03), but a positive correlation with median sedentary time on accelerometry (r = 0.64, P = .02). Pulmonary artery acceleration time positively correlated with peak oxygen consumption on exercise testing (r = 0.64, P = .002). There was no correlation between right ventricular strain measurements and functional capacity testing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this pilot study, tricuspid regurgitant jet and pulmonary artery acceleration time were the echocardiographic variables that correlated most with accelerometry data. With further echocardiographic validation, accelerometry can be a useful, noninvasive, and cost-effective tool to monitor disease progression in patients with PAH.},

Wearable devices, which can track heart rate and physical activity data, are starting to be evaluated for patients' management. We hypothesized that commercial wearable devices (WD) may provide data associated with preoperative evaluation scales and tests, to identify patients with poor functional capacity at increased risk for complications. We conducted a prospective observational study including seventy-year-old patients undergoing two-hour surgeries under general anesthesia. Patients were asked to wear a WD for 7 days before surgery. WD data were compared to preoperatory clinical evaluation scales and with a 6-min walking test (6MWT). We enrolled 31 patients, with a mean age of 76.1 (SD ± 4.9) years. There were 11 (35%) ASA 3-4 patients. 6MWT results averaged 328.9 (SD ± 99.5) m.

This is the first study to evaluate WD as preoperative evaluation tools; we found a strong association between 6MWT, preoperative scales, and WD data. Low-cost wearable devices are a promising tool for the evaluation of cardiopulmonary fitness. Further research is needed to validate WD in this setting.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Hispanic men have disproportionate rates of overweight and obesity compared with other racial and ethnic subpopulations. However, few weight loss interventions have been developed specifically for this high-risk group. Furthermore, the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to support lifestyle behavior changes in weight loss interventions for Hispanic men is largely untested.<h4>Objective</h4>This single-arm pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of integrating mHealth technology into a 12-week gender- and culturally sensitive weight loss intervention (GCSWLI) for Hispanic men with overweight and obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 18 Hispanic men (mean age 38, SD 10.9 years; mean BMI 34.3, SD 5.5 kg/m²; 10/18, 56% Spanish monolingual) received a GCSWLI, including weekly in-person individual sessions, a daily calorie goal, and prescription of ≥225 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. mHealth technology support included tailored SMS text messaging, behavior self-monitoring support using Fitbit Charge 2, and weight tracking using a Fitbit Aria Wi-Fi Smart Scale. Changes in weight from baseline to 12 weeks were estimated using a paired 2-tailed t test. Descriptive analyses characterized the use of Fitbit and smart scales. Semistructured interviews were conducted immediately after intervention to assess the participants' weight loss experiences and perspectives on mHealth technologies.<h4>Results</h4>Of 18 participants, 16 (89%) completed the 12-week assessments; the overall attrition rate was 11.1%. The mean weight loss at week 12 was -4.7 kg (95% CI 7.1 to -2.4 kg; P<.001). Participants wore the Fitbit 71.58% (962/1344) of the intervention days and logged their body weight using the smart scale (410/1344, 30.51% of the intervention days). Participants identified barriers to the use of the technology, such as lack of technological literacy and unreliable internet access for the smart scale.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although clinically significant weight loss was achieved by integrating mHealth technology into the GCSWLI, adherence to the prescribed use of technology was modest. Addressing barriers to the use of such technologies identified in our work may help to refine an mHealth intervention approach for Hispanic men.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02783521; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02783521.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant public health concern worldwide. Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of death in the United States and has a significant negative impact on individuals and society. Relapse following treatment is common, and adjunct intervention approaches to improve alcohol outcomes during early recovery continue to be critical. Interventions focused on increasing physical activity (PA) may improve AUD treatment outcomes. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and activity trackers, integrating this technology into a mobile app may be a feasible, acceptable, and scalable approach for increasing PA in individuals with AUD.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to test the Fit&Sober app developed for patients with AUD. The goals of the app were to facilitate self-monitoring of PA engagement and daily mood and alcohol cravings, increase awareness of immediate benefits of PA on mood and cravings, encourage setting and adjusting PA goals, provide resources and increase knowledge for increasing PA, and serve as a resource for alcohol relapse prevention strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>To preliminarily test the Fit&Sober app, we conducted an open pilot trial of patients with AUD in early recovery (N=22; 13/22, 59% women; mean age 43.6, SD 11.6 years). At the time of hospital admission, participants drank 72% of the days in the last 3 months, averaging 9 drinks per drinking day. The extent to which the Fit&Sober app was feasible and acceptable among patients with AUD during early recovery was examined. Changes in alcohol consumption, PA, anxiety, depression, alcohol craving, and quality of life were also examined after 12 weeks of app use.<h4>Results</h4>Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the Fit&Sober app. App metadata suggested that participants were still using the app approximately 2.5 days per week by the end of the intervention. Pre-post analyses revealed small-to-moderate effects on increase in PA, from a mean of 5784 (SD 2511) steps per day at baseline to 7236 (SD 3130) steps per day at 12 weeks (Cohen d=0.35). Moderate-to-large effects were observed for increases in percentage of abstinent days (Cohen d=2.17) and quality of life (Cohen d=0.58) as well as decreases in anxiety (Cohen d=-0.71) and depression symptoms (Cohen d=-0.58).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Fit&Sober app is an acceptable and feasible approach for increasing PA in patients with AUD during early recovery. A future randomized controlled trial is necessary to determine the efficacy of the Fit&Sober app for long-term maintenance of PA, ancillary mental health, and alcohol outcomes. If the efficacy of the Fit&Sober app could be established, patients with AUD would have a valuable adjunct to traditional alcohol treatment that can be delivered in any setting and at any time, thereby improving the overall health and well-being of this population.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02958280; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02958280.},

Trends in step counts after specific procedures were identified, and higher subjective activity level correlated with step counts (r = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.07-0.41). Among patients with complete step data (n = 24), POD1 steps ≥200 were associated with reduced length of stay (4.5 ± 1.7 days vs. 7.2 ± 4.0 days, 95% CI = 0.33-5.0). Mean TST was 5.4 ± 2.5 h, TST correlated with subjective sleep scores (r = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.03-0.044), and clinical events associated with sleep-wake transitions on Fitbit devices were identified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Wearable activity devices appear feasible for monitoring trends in postoperative ambulation and sleep. Use of these devices may facilitate postoperative recovery.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>Fatigue, and balance and gait disorders can impact on physical activity (PA) levels in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS). To date, several studies have examined PA in pwMS during daily life, but little is known about PA levels in pwMS during a rehabilitation period. The present study investigated PA levels (daily steps, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) in inpatient and outpatients with MS during their rehabilitation period and described the relationship between objectively measured PA and levels of disability, quality of life, fatigue, and self-efficacy.<h4>Methods</h4>In this exploratory cross-sectional study, we examined 40 pwMS during their inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation regime. Participants included in the study (N = 34) wore a Fitbit Versa tracker for one week recording daily steps, minutes of LPA, and minutes of MVPA (primary outcomes). They underwent a clinical assessment of physical activity levels (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire(GLTEQ)), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale(FSS)), walking ability (10 Meter Walk Test(10MWT), 2-Min Walk Test(2MWT), 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking scale(MSWS-12)), quality of life (12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12)), and self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis scale (SEMS)) (secondary outcomes). Multiple linear regressions (MLR) models were used to test whether the demographic difference between the two groups influenced the estimation of objective variables measured by Fitbit. Finally, correlations between objectively measured physical activity and subjective clinical scales were estimated with Spearman correlations.<h4>Results</h4>Our sample consisted of 21 females and 13 males with a mean (interquartile range) age of 52 (20) years and an Expanded Disability Status scale(EDSS) score of 6.0 (1.50) points; baseline characteristics of inpatients (N = 18) and outpatients (N = 16) differed statistically only in EDSS levels (p-value = 0.008) and use of assistive devices (p=0.007). The whole sample performed (mean±standard deviation) 3969±2190 steps per day, with no significant difference between inpatients (3318±1515) and outpatients (4660±2606). No statistical difference was found between the groups in LPA (p-value=0.064). A significant difference in MVPA (p-value < 0.001) was found between inpatients and outpatients, 1.52±3.98 and 14.69±11.56 min per day, respectively. Significant correlations were found between FSS and MVPA both in the whole sample (r(32)= -0.62, p < 0.001) and in the outpatients group (r(14) = -0.66, p = 0.005), and between 10MWT and daily steps (whole sample:(r(32) = 0.48, p = 0.005), outpatients:(r(14)= -0.51, p = 0.05)).<h4>Conclusions</h4>PwMS in our study overall engaged in reduced and less intense levels of daily PA with respect to the guidelines with inpatients performing almost no vigorous activities. Considering the importance of PA in improving physical and mental well-being, clinicians and researchers should develope strategies to increase daily PA of PwMS during their rehabilitation programs and daily life.},

These data may have important implication for personalized treatments of degenerative spine disease. However, no large-scale study has examined the feasibility and acceptability of these methods in spine surgery patients.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multimodal preoperative mHealth assessment in patients with degenerative spine disease.<h4>Methods</h4>Adults undergoing elective spine surgery were provided with Fitbit trackers and sent preoperative ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) assessing pain, disability, mood, and catastrophizing 5 times daily for 3 weeks. Objective adherence rates and a subjective acceptability survey were used to evaluate feasibility of these methods.<h4>Results</h4>The 77 included participants completed an average of 82 EMAs each, with an average completion rate of 86%. Younger age and chronic pulmonary disease were significantly associated with lower EMA adherence. Seventy-two (93%) participants completed Fitbit monitoring and wore the Fitbits for an average of 247 hours each. On average, participants wore the Fitbits for at least 12 hours per day for 15 days. Only worse mood scores were independently associated with lower Fitbit adherence. Most participants endorsed positive experiences with the study protocol, including 91% who said they would be willing to complete EMAs to improve their preoperative surgical guidance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Spine fusion candidates successfully completed a preoperative multimodal mHealth assessment with high acceptability.

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>Wearables have great potential to improve monitoring and delivery of physical activity interventions to older adults with downstream benefits to multisystem health and longevity; however, benefits obtained from wearables depend on their uptake and usage. Few studies have examined person-specific factors that relate to wearable adherence. We characterized adherence to using a wearable activity tracker for 30 days and examined associations between adherence and demographics, cognitive functioning, brain volumes, and technology familiarity among community-dwelling older adults.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants were 175 older adults enrolled in the UCSF Longitudinal Brain Aging Study who were asked to wear a Fitbit<sup>TM</sup> Flex 2 during waking hours for 30 days. Sixty two of these participants were also asked to sync their devices to the Fitbit smartphone app daily to collect minute-level data. We calculated adherence to wearing the Fitbit daily (i.e., proportion of days with valid activity data) and adherence to daily device syncing (i.e., proportion of days with minute-level activity data). Participants also completed a brain MRI and in-person cognitive testing measuring memory, executive functioning, and processing speed. Spearman correlations, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and logistic regression tested relationships between wearable adherence and clinicodemographic factors.<h4>Results</h4>Participants wore the Fitbits for an average of 95% of study days and were 85% adherent to the daily syncing protocol. Greater adherence to wearing the device was related to female sex. Greater adherence to daily device syncing was related to better memory, independent of demographic factors. Wearable adherence was not significantly related to age, education, executive functioning, processing speed, brain gray matter volumes, or self-reported familiarity with technology. Participants reported little-to-no difficulty using the wearable and all reported willingness to participate in another wearable study in the future.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Older adults have overall high adherence to wearable use in the current study protocol. Person-specific factors, however, may represent potential barriers to equitable uptake of wearables for physical activity among older adults, including demographics and cognitive functioning. Future studies and clinical providers utilizing wearable activity trackers with older adults may benefit from implementation of reminders (e.g., texts, calls) for device use, particularly among men and individuals with memory impairment.},

Remotely delivered programs which harness wearable technology may potentially be beneficial.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a remotely delivered, physical activity intervention which harnessed wearable technology.<h4>Methods</h4>This single arm pre-post longitudinal study included cancer survivors who had completed treatment in the preceding 3 years. Participants were supplied with a Fitbit One® or Flex® for 12 weeks. Physical activity goals were discussed during support phone calls. Outcome measures, assessed at baseline (T1), 12 weeks (T2), and 24 weeks (T3), included feasibility (recruitment, adherence, safety, acceptability) and efficacy [physical activity (Godin leisure time Index, ActiGraph GT3X+), quality of life (functional assessment of cancer therapy - general, short form 36 physical functioning component), functional capacity (six-minute walk test)].<h4>Results</h4>Forty-five participants completed T1 assessments (10 males, 35 females). Thirty-nine (86.6%) of those underwent assessment at T2 and 31 (68.8%) at T3. The intervention was perceived positively with no adverse effects. There were increases in functional capacity (six-minute walk test, p = .002) between T1-T3, an increase in quality of life [short form 36 physical functioning measure (p = .0035), functional assessment of cancer total score (p = .02)] and self-report physical activity levels (p = .000123) between T1-T2, although effect sizes were generally low (d = 0.180 to d = 0.418). Objectively measured physical activity did not change.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A physical activity intervention including wearable technology was safe, feasible, and well received by cancer survivors. An intervention based on this proof of concept should be followed up in further studies.},

Consumer wearable devices can be useful tools for athletes. In order to use consumer wearable devices in clinical research, it is essential to conduct a validation study. Thus, we conducted a validation study to assess the Fitbit Alta HR<sup>TM</sup> (FBA)- a consumer wearable device with an accelerometer and a heart rate monitor to detect sleep stages and quality against electroencephalographic (EEG) studies in athletes.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Forty college athletes participated in the study. EEG was applied to participants simultaneously while wearing FBA.<h4>Results</h4>Regarding sleep parameters, there was a strong correlation between the total sleep time (TST)-EEG and the TST-Fitbit (r = 0.83; p < 0.001). Regarding the sleep stages, there was a modest correlation between the N3 sleep-EEG and the N3 sleep-Fitbit (r = 0.68; p < 0.001). In addition, there was a strong correlation between the percentage of N3 sleep in between sleep onset and initial rapid eye movement sleep-EEG and those on Fitbit (r = 0.73; p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results demonstrate that FBA facilitates sleep monitoring and exhibits acceptable agreement with EEG. Therefore, FBA is a useful tool in athletes' sleep management.},

	Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique academic, social, financial, and health-related challenges for young adults. While numerous studies have documented average increases in reported mental health issues in the general population, few have measured the magnitude of changes in mental health symptoms and sleep difficulties within individuals. Here, we measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep of university students pre- and mid-pandemic. Prior to the pandemic (Fall 2019), individuals (n = 23) were recruited to participate in an eight-day, comprehensive sleep study using Fitbit® actigraphy. Participants also completed detailed mental health and sleep surveys, including depression (BDI-II), anxiety (STAI), and sleep disturbance (PROMIS) surveys. One year later, these individuals repeated the study during the pandemic (Fall 2020); participants completed the original surveys and sleep study, in addition to a targeted survey on mental and sleep health due to the pandemic. Self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and sleep parameters, measured by actigraphy, were compared within the same individuals pre- and mid-pandemic. Self-report survey data revealed that three-quarters of participants experienced an increase in stress and anxiety due to the pandemic. In addition, intra-individual depression and anxiety symptoms increased to clinically significant levels within individuals from pre- to mid-pandemic. Over two-thirds of participants reported sleeping less, and more than half reported that their sleep health had worsened during the pandemic. Changes in sleep disturbance were positively associated with changes in depression and anxiety, reinforcing the robust relationship between poor sleep quality and mental health. Furthermore, individuals who reported greater sleep disturbance during the pandemic experienced lower relative proportions of both REM and deep sleep. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students is multi-faceted-mental health, sleep quality, and the amount of restorative sleep are negatively affected by the pandemic environment. These compounded effects exacerbate the health consequences of the pandemic and highlight a need for increased attention to the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders, particularly in vulnerable populations of young adults.},

Most of the systems are between 91 and 97%; in terms of delay comparison, the delay of the Im-HMS system is between 18 and 39 ms, which is far lower than the lowest value of the UCD system of 84 ms, and the Im-HMS is significantly better than the existing UCD system; the error range of Im-HMS is mainly between 0.2 and 1.4, while the error range of UCD system is mainly between -2 and 14; and in terms of efficiency and energy utilization, Im-HMS values are higher than those of UCD system. In general, the Im-HMS system proposed in this study is more accurate than UCD system and has lower delay, smaller error, and higher efficiency, and energy utilization is more efficient than UCD system, which is of great significance for mobile health monitoring in practical applications.},

Since the timings of these updates are not publicized, an analytic approach is necessary to determine whether changes in mHealth data are due to lifestyle behaviors or algorithmic updates. Existing methods for identifying changepoints do not consider multiple types of changepoints, may require prespecifying the number of changepoints, and often involve nonintuitive parameters. We propose a novel approach, Automated Selection of Changepoints using Empirical <i>P</i>-values and Trimming (ASCEPT), to select an optimal set of changepoints in mHealth data.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>ASCEPT involves 2 stages: (1) identification of a statistically significant set of changepoints from sequential iterations of a changepoint detection algorithm; and (2) trimming changepoints within linear and seasonal trends. ASCEPT is available at https://github.com/matthewquinn1/changepointSelect.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate ASCEPT's utility using real-world mHealth data collected through the Precision VISSTA study. We also demonstrate that ASCEPT outperforms a comparable method, circular binary segmentation, and illustrate the impact when adjusting for changepoints in downstream analysis.<h4>Discussion</h4>ASCEPT offers a practical approach for identifying changepoints in mHealth data that result from algorithmic updates. ASCEPT's only required parameters are a significance level and goodness-of-fit threshold, offering a more intuitive option compared to other approaches.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ASCEPT provides an intuitive and useful way to identify which changepoints in mHealth data are likely the result of updates to the underlying algorithms that process the data.},

During a baseline-week and a post-intervention week, sleep duration (Fitbit Alta and self-report), sleep quality, and stress were assessed daily and saliva was collected to assess the cortisol awakening response (CAR). In total, self-reported sleep quality and duration increased, but there was no meaningful condition*week interaction for sleep parameters or CAR. Higher average stress was associated with shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality. Within-person, days with higher stress were followed by nights with lower sleep quality. Despite overall improvements, effects of MCII were not confirmed. MCII might be less effective to improve behaviors which are less controllable.},

Recent advances in predictive analytics and wearable technology for behavior assessment show promise but require further investigation. Yet, previous studies have only assessed other health outcomes and monitored patients for short durations (7−14 days). This study explores how behaviors reported by a consumer wearable can assist VA risk prediction. An exploratory observational study was conducted with participants who had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and wore a Fitbit Alta HR consumer wearable. Fitbit reported behavioral markers for physical activity (light, fair, vigorous), sleep, and heart rate. A case-crossover analysis using conditional logistic regression assessed the effects of time-adjusted behaviors over 1−8 weeks on VA incidence. Twenty-seven patients (25 males, median age 59 years) were included. Among the participants, ICDs recorded 262 VA events during 8093 days monitored by Fitbit (median follow-up period 960 days). Longer light to fair activity durations and a higher heart rate increased the odds of a VA event (p < 0.001). In contrast, lengthier fair to vigorous activity and sleep durations decreased the odds of a VA event (p < 0.001). Future studies using consumer wearables in a larger population should prioritize these outcomes to further assess VA risk.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Sensors are increasingly used in health interventions to unobtrusively and continuously capture participants' physical activity in free-living conditions. The rich granularity of sensor data offers great potential for analyzing patterns and changes in physical activity behaviors. The use of specialized machine learning and data mining techniques to detect, extract, and analyze these patterns has increased, helping to better understand how participants' physical activity evolves.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this systematic review was to identify and present the various data mining techniques employed to analyze changes in physical activity behaviors from sensors-derived data in health education and health promotion intervention studies. We addressed two main research questions: (1) What are the current techniques used for mining physical activity sensor data to detect behavior changes in health education or health promotion contexts? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities in mining physical activity sensor data for detecting physical activity behavior changes?<h4>Methods</h4>The systematic review was performed in May 2021 using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We queried the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Springer literature databases for peer-reviewed references related to wearable machine learning to detect physical activity changes in health education. A total of 4388 references were initially retrieved from the databases. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 285 references were subjected to full-text review, resulting in 19 articles included for analysis.<h4>Results</h4>All studies used accelerometers, sometimes in combination with another sensor (37%). Data were collected over a period ranging from 4 days to 1 year (median 10 weeks) from a cohort size ranging between 10 and 11615 (median 74). Data preprocessing was mainly carried out using proprietary software, generally resulting in step counts and time spent in physical activity aggregated predominantly at the daily or minute level. The main features used as input for the data mining models were descriptive statistics of the preprocessed data. The most common data mining methods were classifiers, clusters, and decision-making algorithms, and these focused on personalization (58%) and analysis of physical activity behaviors (42%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Mining sensor data offers great opportunities to analyze physical activity behavior changes, build models to better detect and interpret behavior changes, and allow for personalized feedback and support for participants, especially where larger sample sizes and longer recording times are available. Exploring different data aggregation levels can help detect subtle and sustained behavior changes. However, the literature suggests that there is still work remaining to improve the transparency, explicitness, and standardization of the data preprocessing and mining processes to establish best practices and make the detection methods easier to understand, scrutinize, and reproduce.},

Changes in activity were statistically significant when estimates (Δ%) did not intercept zero.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, there was a decrease in mean steps (-1584 steps/day; Δ% -9%, 95% CI -11% to -7%); METs (-83 METs/day; Δ% -5%, 95% CI -6% to -5%); and lightly active (Δ% -4%, 95% CI -8% to -1%), fairly active (Δ% -8%, 95% CI -21% to -15%), and very active (Δ% -8%, 95% CI -11% to -5%) intensity minutes per day, and increases in mean sedentary minutes per day (51 mins/day; Δ% 3%, 95% CI 1%-6%). Only very active (+5.1 mins) and sedentary (+4.3 mins) bout durations changed significantly.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In a convenience sample of adults with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were associated with decreases in overall activity levels and increases in very active and sedentary bout durations. A Fitbit monitor provided meaningful continuous long-term data in this context.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618001159246; https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12618001159246.},

	Abstract = {Sleep duration, sleep deprivation and the sleep-wake cycle are thought to play an important role in the generation of epileptic activity and may also influence seizure risk. Hence, people diagnosed with epilepsy are commonly asked to maintain consistent sleep routines. However, emerging evidence paints a more nuanced picture of the relationship between seizures and sleep, with bidirectional effects between changes in sleep and seizure risk in addition to modulation by sleep stages and transitions between stages. We conducted a longitudinal study investigating sleep parameters and self-reported seizure occurrence in an ambulatory at-home setting using mobile and wearable monitoring. Sixty subjects wore a Fitbit smartwatch for at least 28 days while reporting their seizure activity in a mobile app. Multiple sleep features were investigated, including duration, oversleep and undersleep, and sleep onset and offset times. Sleep features in participants with epilepsy were compared to a large (n = 37921) representative population of Fitbit users, each with 28 days of data. For participants with at least 10 seizure days (n = 34), sleep features were analysed for significant changes prior to seizure days. A total of 4956 reported seizures (M = 83, SD = 130) and 30485 recorded sleep nights (M = 508, SD = 445) were included in the study. There was a trend for participants with epilepsy to sleep longer than the general population, although this difference was not significant. Just 5 of 34 participants showed a significant difference in sleep duration the night before seizure days compared to seizure-free days. However, 14 of 34 subjects showed significant differences between their sleep onset (bed) and/or offset (wake) times prior to seizure occurrence. In contrast to previous studies, the current study found undersleeping was associated with a marginal 2% decrease in seizure risk in the following 48 h (p < 0.01). Nocturnal seizures were associated with both significantly longer sleep durations and increased risk of a seizure occurring in the following 48 h. Overall, the presented results demonstrated that day-to-day changes in sleep duration had a minimal effect on reported seizures, while patient-specific changes in bed- and wake-times were more important for identifying seizure risk the following day. Nocturnal seizures were the only factor that significantly increased the risk of seizures in the following 48 h on a group level. Wearables can be utilised to identify these sleep-seizure relationships and guide clinical recommendations or improve seizure forecasting algorithms.},

This article explores the use of Fitbit activity trackers to assess physical activity and its impact on prediabetic patient health.<h4>Methods</h4>Intervention study. In total, 30 volunteers (9 males and 21 females), aged 32-65 years, with impaired glucose levels and without diabetes or moving disorders, received Fitbit Inspire activity trackers and physical activity recommendations. A routine blood check was taken during the first and second visits, and body composition was analyzed. Physical activity variability in time was assessed using a Poincare plot.<h4>Results</h4>The count of steps per day and variability differed between patients and during the research period, but the change in total physical activity was not statistically significant. Significant positive correlations between changes in lipid values, body mass composition, and variability of steps count, distance, and minutes of very active physical activity were observed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>When assessing physical activity, data doctors should evaluate not just the totals or the medians of the steps count, but also physical activity variability in time. The study shows that most changes were better linked to the physical activity variability than the total count of physical activity.},

Social cognitive predictors based on the health action process approach (HAPA) and user experience were assessed via questionnaires.<h4>Results</h4>The MVPA increased by an average of 19 min per week and steps by 1317 per day. An additional benefit of the role model component could be observed for MVPA. In the follow-up, the intervention effect was still significant for the number of steps, while MVPA dropped back to baseline. Multilevel models including HAPA variables explained small but significant amounts of variance in MVPA (8% within-person, 26% between-person) and steps (11% within-person, 12% between-person). User experience was rated as very high.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Providing an intervention based on established behavior change techniques and self-monitoring via wearables seems to be effective for increasing physical activity among older adults. The HAPA variables seem to play a limited role to explain activity levels. Acceptance of wearables can be expected to be high.},

	Abstract = {Physical activity can benefit both physical and mental well-being. Different forms of exercise (e.g., aerobic versus anaerobic; running versus walking, swimming, or yoga; high-intensity interval training versus endurance workouts; etc.) impact physical fitness in different ways. For example, running may substantially impact leg and heart strength but only moderately impact arm strength. We hypothesized that the mental benefits of physical activity might be similarly differentiated. We focused specifically on how different intensities of physical activity might relate to different aspects of memory and mental health. To test our hypothesis, we collected (in aggregate) roughly a century's worth of fitness data. We then asked participants to fill out surveys asking them to self-report on different aspects of their mental health. We also asked participants to engage in a battery of memory tasks that tested their short and long term episodic, semantic, and spatial memory performance. We found that participants with similar physical activity habits and fitness profiles tended to also exhibit similar mental health and task performance profiles. These effects were task-specific in that different physical activity patterns or fitness characteristics varied with different aspects of memory, on different tasks. Taken together, these findings provide foundational work for designing physical activity interventions that target specific components of cognitive performance and mental health by leveraging low-cost fitness tracking devices.},

However, the promise of RMT data depends heavily on sustained user engagement over extended periods. In this paper, we report a longitudinal qualitative study of the subjective experience of people with MDD engaging with RMTs to provide insight into system usability and user experience and to provide the basis for future promotion of RMT use in research and clinical practice.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to understand the subjective experience of long-term engagement with RMTs using qualitative data collected in a longitudinal study of RMTs for monitoring MDD. The objectives were to explore the key themes associated with long-term RMT use and to identify recommendations for future system engagement.<h4>Methods</h4>In this multisite, longitudinal qualitative research study, 124 semistructured interviews were conducted with 99 participants across the United Kingdom, Spain, and the Netherlands at 3-month, 12-month, and 24-month time points during a study exploring RMT use (the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Major Depressive Disorder study). Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded in the native language, with the resulting quotes translated into English.<h4>Results</h4>There were 5 main themes regarding the subjective experience of long-term RMT use: research-related factors, the utility of RMTs for self-management, technology-related factors, clinical factors, and system amendments and additions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The subjective experience of long-term RMT use can be considered from 2 main perspectives: experiential factors (how participants construct their experience of engaging with RMTs) and system-related factors (direct engagement with the technologies). A set of recommendations based on these strands are proposed for both future research and the real-world implementation of RMTs into clinical practice. Future exploration of experiential engagement with RMTs will be key to the successful use of RMTs in clinical care.},

This scoping review explored the types, mechanisms, and accuracy of wearable technology for the early detection of COVID-19. This review was conducted according to the five-step framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Studies published between December 31, 2019 and December 15, 2021 were obtained from 10 electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Taylor & Francis Online. Grey literature, reference lists, and key journals were also searched. All types of articles describing wearable technology for the detection of COVID-19 infection were included. Two reviewers independently screened the articles against the eligibility criteria and extracted the data using a data charting form. A total of 40 articles were included in this review. There are 22 different types of wearable technology used to detect COVID-19 infections early in the existing literature and are categorized as smartwatches or fitness trackers (67%), medical devices (27%), or others (6%). Based on deviations in physiological characteristics, anomaly detection models that can detect COVID-19 infection early were built using artificial intelligence or statistical analysis techniques. Reported area-under-the-curve values ranged from 75% to 94.4%, and sensitivity and specificity values ranged from 36.5% to 100% and 73% to 95.3%, respectively. Further research is necessary to validate the effectiveness and clinical dependability of wearable technology before healthcare policymakers can mandate its use for remote surveillance.},

Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry trial registration number ACTRN12621000609853.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred volunteers aged 18-65 years received either 125 mg of <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> twice daily or a placebo. Outcome measures included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (primary outcome measure), Profile of Mood States, Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Restorative Sleep Questionnaire, and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29. Sleep quality was also assessed using a wrist-worn sleep tracker (Fitbit), and stress changes were examined by measuring between-group differences in hair cortisol and stress responses after exposure to an experiment stress procedure known as the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST).<h4>Results</h4>Compared to the placebo, <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> supplementation was associated with greater improvements in PSS (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and AIS (<i>p</i> = 0.025) scores; and at week 8, concentrations in hair cortisol were also lower (<i>p</i> = 0.025). Moreover, <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> supplementation was associated with a buffered stress responses after exposure to the MAST as demonstrated by significantly lower concentrations in salivary cortisol (<i>p</i> = 0.001), salivary amylase (<i>p</i> = 0.001), systolic (<i>p</i> = 0.010) and diastolic (<i>p</i> = 0.025) blood pressure, and subjective stress ratings (<i>p</i> < 0.001). <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> supplementation was well-tolerated with no reports of major adverse effects.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results from this trial suggest that 8 weeks of supplementation with an <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> extract (Holixer<sup>TM</sup>) may reduce objective and subjective measures of stress, and improve subjective measures of sleep quality.

As more studies are being carried out on children and adolescents in terms of sedentary behavior (SB) assessment, knowledge about accurate and precise monitoring devices becomes increasingly important.<h4>Objective</h4>The main aim of this systematic review was to investigate and communicate findings on the accuracy and precision of consumer-grade physical activity monitors in assessing the time spent in SB in children and adolescents.<h4>Methods</h4>Searches of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, SPORTDiscus (full text), ProQuest, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, DART Europe E-theses Portal, and Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations electronic databases were performed. All relevant studies that compared different types of consumer-grade monitors using a comparison method in the assessment of SB, published in European languages from 2015 onward were considered for inclusion. The risk of bias was estimated using Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments. For enabling comparisons of accuracy measures within the studied outcome domain, measurement accuracy interpretation was based on group mean or percentage error values and 90% CI. Acceptable limits were predefined as -10% to +10% error in controlled and free-living settings. For determining the number of studies with group error percentages that fall within or outside one of the sides from previously defined acceptable limits, two 1-sided tests of equivalence were carried out, and the direction of measurement error was examined.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 8 studies complied with the predefined inclusion criteria, and 3 studies provided acceptable data for quantitative analyses. In terms of the presented accuracy comparisons, 14 were subsequently identified, with 6 of these comparisons being acceptable in terms of quantitative analysis. The results of the Cochran Q test indicated that the included studies did not share a common effect size (Q<sub>5</sub>=82.86; P<.001). I<sup>2</sup>, which represents the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity, amounted to 94%. The summary effect size based on the random effects model was not statistically significant (effect size=14.36, SE 12.04, 90% CI -5.45 to 34.17; P=.23). According to the equivalence test results, consumer-grade physical activity monitors did not generate equivalent estimates of SB in relation to the comparison methods. Majority of the studies (3/7, 43%) that reported the mean absolute percentage errors have reported values of <30%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first study that has attempted to synthesize available evidence on the accuracy and precision of consumer-grade physical activity monitors in measuring SB in children and adolescents. We found very few studies on the accuracy and almost no evidence on the precision of wearable activity monitors. The presented results highlight the large heterogeneity in this area of research.<h4>Trial registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD42021251922; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=251922.},

	Author = {Sarwar, Atifa and Agu, Emmanuel},
	Abstract = {To investigate whether a deep learning model can detect Covid-19 from disruptions in the human body's physiological (heart rate) and rest-activity rhythms (rhythmic dysregulation) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We propose CovidRhythm, a novel Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) that combines sensor and rhythmic features extracted from heart rate and activity (steps) data gathered passively using consumer-grade smart wearable to predict Covid-19. A total of 39 features were extracted (standard deviation, mean, min/max/avg length of sedentary and active bouts) from wearable sensor data. Biobehavioral rhythms were modeled using nine parameters (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and intra-daily variability). These features were then input to CovidRhythm for predicting Covid-19 in the incubation phase (one day before biological symptoms manifest). A combination of sensor and biobehavioral rhythm features achieved the highest AUC-ROC of 0.79 [Sensitivity = 0.69, Specificity=0.89, F$_\{0.1\}$ = 0.76], outperforming prior approaches in discriminating Covid-positive patients from healthy controls using 24 hours of historical wearable physiological. Rhythmic features were the most predictive of Covid-19 infection when utilized either alone or in conjunction with sensor features. Sensor features predicted healthy subjects best. Circadian rest-activity rhythms that combine 24h activity and sleep information were the most disrupted. CovidRhythm demonstrates that biobehavioral rhythms derived from consumer-grade wearable data can facilitate timely Covid-19 detection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to detect Covid-19 using deep learning and biobehavioral rhythms features derived from consumer-grade wearable data.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Physical activity recovery after pediatric surgery can be assessed using objective measures such as step counts, but practice currently relies on subjective assessment by proxy. It is unclear how subjective and objective assessments of activity relate. We compared caregiver assessment of return to normal physical activity after pediatric appendectomy to step count recovery measured by a Fitbit.<h4>Methods</h4>Pediatric patients who underwent appendectomy were recruited between 2020 and 2022 to be monitored for 21 d with a Fitbit. Patients were grouped by the postoperative day (POD) (7, 14, or 21) their caregiver first reported their activity was "back to normal." Objective return to normal step count was estimated for each group by modeling the inflection point from increasing steps to a plateau. These measures were determined discordant if the subjective report remained outside the modeled 95% confidence interval (CI) for the day the group plateaued.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-nine simple appendicitis and 40 complicated appendicitis patients were recruited. Among simple appendicitis patients, daily steps plateaued on POD 10.8 (95% CI 7.4-14.3), POD 14.0 (95% CI 11.0-17.1), and POD 11.1 (95% CI 6.9-15.3) for the day 7, day 14, and day 21 groups, respectively. Complicated appendicitis groups plateaued on POD 12.8 (95% CI 8.7-16.9), POD 15.2 (95% CI 11.1-19.3), and POD 16.7 (95% CI 12.3-21.0), respectively. Significant discordance was observed between subjective and objective assessments for the day 7 and day 14 simple groups and for the day 7 complicated group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There was significant discordance between caregiver and accelerometer-assessed activity recovery after pediatric surgery.

	Abstract = {Leading a sedentary lifestyle may cause numerous health problems. Therefore, passive lifestyle changes should be given priority to avoid severe long-term damage. Automatic health coaching system may help people manage a healthy lifestyle with continuous health state monitoring and personalized recommendation generation with machine learning (ML). This study proposes a semantic ontology model to annotate the ML-prediction outcomes and personal preferences to conceptualize personalized recommendation generation with a hybrid approach. We use a transfer learning approach to improve ML model training and its performance, and an incremental learning approach to handle daily growing data and fit them into the ML models. Furthermore, we propose a personalized activity recommendation algorithm for a healthy lifestyle by combining transfer learning, incremental learning, the proposed semantic ontology model, and personal preference data. For the overall experiment, we use public and private activity datasets collected from healthy adults (n = 33 for public datasets; n = 16 for private datasets). The standard ML algorithms have been used to investigate the possibility of classifying daily physical activity levels into the following activity classes: sedentary (0), low active (1), active (2), highly active (3), and rigorous active (4). The daily step count, low physical activity, medium physical activity, and vigorous physical activity serve as input for the classification models. We first use publicly available Fitbit datasets to build the initial classification models. Subsequently, we re-use the pre-trained ML classifiers on the real-time MOX2-5 dataset using transfer learning. We test several standard algorithms and select the best-performing model with optimized configuration for our use case by empirical testing. We find that DecisionTreeClassifier with a criterion "entropy" outperforms other ML classifiers with a mean accuracy score of 97.50% (F1 = 97.00, precision = 97.00, recall = 98.00, MCC = 96.78) and 96.10% (F1 = 96.00, precision = 96.00, recall = 96.00, MCC = 96.10) in Fitbit and MOX2-5 datasets, respectively. Using transfer learning, the DecisionTreeClassifier with a criterion "entropy" outperforms other classifiers with a mean accuracy score of 97.99% (F1 = 98.00, precision = 98.00, recall = 98.00, MCC = 96.79). Therefore, the transfer learning approach improves the machine learning model performance by ≈ 1.98% for defined datasets and settings on MOX2-5 datasets. The Hermit reasoner outperforms other reasoners with an average reasoning time of 1.1-2.1 s, under defined settings in our proposed ontology model. Our proposed algorithm for personalized recommendations conceptualizes a direction to combine the classification results and personal preferences in an ontology for activity eCoaching. The proposed method of combining machine learning technology with semantic rules is an invaluable asset in personalized recommendation generation. Moreover, the semantic rules in the knowledge base and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) query processing in the query engine helps to understand the logic behind the personalized recommendation generation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Physical activity (PA) is known to improve quality of life (QoL) as well as reduce mortality and disease progression in individuals with chronic neurological disorders. However, Latina women are less likely to participate in recommended levels of PA due to common socioeconomic barriers, including limited resources and access to exercise programs. Therefore, we developed a community-based intervention with activity monitoring and behavioral coaching to target these barriers and facilitate sustained participation in an exercise program promoting PA.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a community-based intervention to promote PA through self-monitoring via a Fitbit and behavioral coaching among Latina participants with chronic neurological disorders.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a proof-of-concept study among 21 Spanish-speaking Latina participants recruited from the Los Angeles County and University of Southern California (LAC+USC) neurology clinic; participants enrolled in the 16-week intervention at The Wellness Center at The Historic General Hospital in Los Angeles. Demographic data were assessed at baseline. Feasibility was defined by participant attrition and Fitbit adherence. PA promotion was determined by examining change in time spent performing moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) over the 16-week period. The effect of behavioral coaching was assessed by quantifying the difference in MVPA on days when coaching occurred versus on days without coaching. Change in psychometric measures (baseline vs postintervention) and medical center visits (16 weeks preintervention vs during the intervention) were also examined.<h4>Results</h4>Participants were of low socioeconomic status and acculturation. A total of 19 out of 21 (90%) participants completed the study (attrition 10%), with high Fitbit wear adherence (mean 90.31%, SD 10.12%). Time performing MVPA gradually increased by a mean of 0.16 (SD 0.23) minutes per day (P<.001), which was equivalent to an increase of approximately 18 minutes in MVPA over the course of the 16-week study period. Behavioral coaching enhanced intervention effectiveness as evidenced by a higher time spent on MVPA on days when coaching occurred via phone (37 min/day, P=.02) and in person (45.5 min/day, P=.01) relative to days without coaching (24 min/day). Participants improved their illness perception (effect size g=0.30) and self-rated QoL (effect size g=0.32). Additionally, a reduction in the number of medical center visits was observed (effect size r=0.44), and this reduction was associated with a positive change in step count during the study period (P.=04).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Self-monitoring with behavioral coaching is a feasible community-based intervention for PA promotion among Latina women of low socioeconomic status with chronic neurological conditions. PA is known to be important for brain health in neurological conditions but remains relatively unexplored in minority populations.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04820153; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04820153.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>Persistent post-concussion symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can impact function and participation of adults. Physical activity is recommended to reduce symptoms and foster return to normal activities. Adults with a mTBI may have personal factors or experience accessibility issues restricting physical activity. Walking is a physical activity accessible to most that could be delivered remotely.<h4>Objectives</h4>Determine the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of a remotely delivered progressive walking intervention designed for adults with persistent mTBI symptoms and explore its effects on health-related outcomes.<h4>Methodology</h4>This feasibility study using a single-group pre-post mixed methods convergent parallel design was conducted remotely. Adults aged 18-65 years with a mTBI reporting persistent symptoms for ≥3 months were recruited. The 8-week remote progressive walking intervention aimed to increase the weekly number of steps walked by 40% based on a 1-week baseline measured by a Fitbit Inspire 2 activity monitor. Feasibility measures were about the intervention, its remote delivery, safety, and acceptability. Health-related outcomes were post-concussion symptoms, kinesiophobia, mood, sleep, fatigue, and quality of life. Semi-structured exit interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately, and results merged, compared, and contrasted. Descriptive statistics and paired samples <i>t</i>-tests were used. The qualitative analyses followed an iterative content analysis approach using reflexivity and triangulation of sources.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty adults (16 women) aged 42.5 ± 11.51 years with persisting symptoms for 9.25 ± 6.43 months participated, adhered to 94.38% of sessions, completed the intervention, and found it to be feasible, safe and acceptable. Participants increased weekly total number of steps walked (change = 14,886 ± 18,283; <i>t</i> = 3.55, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Severity of post-concussion symptoms (change = -6.42 ± 10.69; <i>t</i> = -2.62, <i>p</i> = 0.018), kinesiophobia (change = -5 ± 6.86; <i>t</i> = 3.18, <i>p</i> = 0.005), anxiety (change = -1.53 ± 3.01; <i>t</i> = -2.21, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and fatigue (change = -10.21 ± 10.20; <i>t</i> = -4.37, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were reduced, whilst quality of life improved (change = 10.58 ± 13.35; <i>t</i> = 3.46, <i>p</i> = 0.003). Participants' perceptions corroborate most quantitative results; they felt improved self-efficacy about physical activity and provided five key recommendations.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of the remote 8-week progressive walking intervention, a promising approach to reduce persisting symptoms, improve physical activity level health-related outcomes and quality of life of adults with persistent post-concussion symptoms following a mTBI.},

This provides two parameters, mean and standard deviation, which when combined with similar parameters estimated from control series, provide a Health Index. <h4>Results</h4> For 90% of 31 cases, the Health Index tracked COVID-19 infection with the virus and subsequent recovery. The first-sign of COVID-19 was detected on average nine days before symptoms were reported. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Early detection of COVID-19 may lead to a reduction in the spread of the virus. The Heath Index’s potential use for the early detection of complications arising from Long COVID would be an important innovation.},

Wearable activity trackers (wearables) show potential for increasing children's PA; however, few studies have explored families' acceptance of wearables. This study investigated the acceptability of using wearables in a family setting, aligning experiences with components of the Technology Acceptance Model and Theoretical Domains Framework. Twenty-four families, with children aged 5-9 years, took part in a 5-week study, where all members were provided with a Fitbit Alta HR for 4 weeks. Acceptability was measured using weekly surveys and pre-post-questionnaires. Nineteen families participated in a focus group. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated using the Pillar Integration Process technique. Pillars reflected (1) external variables impacting wearable use and PA and (2) wearable use, (3) ease of use, (4) usefulness for increasing PA and other health outcomes, (5) attitudes, and (6) intention to use a wearable, including future intervention suggestions. Families found the Fitbit easy to use and acceptable, but use varied, and perceived impact on PA were mixed, with external variables contributing towards this. This study provides insights into how wearables may be integrated into family-based PA interventions and highlights barriers and facilitators of family wearable use.},

	Abstract = {This expert review aimed to assess current literature on the effect and tracking of physical activity during pregnancy and associated outcomes. Self-reported physical activity may be inaccurate given the subjective nature of the questionnaires. The accelerometer ActiGraph is considered the "gold standard" to objectively measure physical activity. However, other more user-friendly wearable devices are now widely available and may accurately track physical activity. Conclusive data from both validated activity questionnaires and accelerometers indicate that physical activity is safe during pregnancy. In addition, studies of physical activity during pregnancy that evaluate pregnancy outcomes have found reduced risks of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus and improved mental health among individuals who regularly engage in physical activity. In the United States, approximately 48% of pregnant individuals gain more than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy; excessive gestational weight gain is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal complications, including preterm birth, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus, and corresponding higher adverse short- and long-term maternal and offspring health outcomes. Although physical activity is safe during pregnancy and may reduce excessive gestational weight gain and resultant pregnancy complications, further research is needed to determine the frequency and duration of specific types of physical activity during pregnancy. Providers should encourage physical activity before and during pregnancy and educate patients regarding the benefits and safety of physical activity.},

Moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA), steps, and sedentary time (ST) were assessed using ActiGraph wGT3X-BT. The FB+ group significantly increased PA [+1854 (2518) steps/day, p < .01] and MVPA [+26 (34) mins/day, p < .05], and decreased their ST [-63 (73) mins/day, p < .01]. The FB group significantly increased  MVPA [+11 (16) mins/day, p < .05], and decreased their ST [-87 (117) mins/day, p < .01]. Participants in FB+ had a significantly greater increase in MVPA/day compared to FB only with a between-group effect size of 0.6 (p < .05). Using Fitbit for self-monitoring is effective in increasing PA and reducing ST among pre-hypertensive and hypertensive participants. Additional behaviour change support amplified the intervention effectiveness for promoting MVPA.},

Feasibility was calculated as the percentage of caregivers who logged into <i>ONC Roadmap</i> and engaged with it at least twice weekly for at least 50% of the 120-day study duration. Feasibility and acceptability was also assessed through a Feasibility and Acceptability questionnaire and the Mobile App Rating Scale to specifically assess app-quality. Exploratory analyses were also conducted to assess HRQOL self- or parent proxy assessments and physiological data capture.<h4>Results</h4>Between September 2020-September 2021, 100 participants (or 50 caregiver-patient dyads) consented and enrolled in the ONC Roadmap study for 120-days. Feasibility of the study was met, wherein the majority of caregivers (N=32; 65%) logged into ONC Roadmap and engaged with it at least twice weekly for at least 50% of the study duration (defined <i>a priori</i> in the Protocol). The Feasibility and Acceptability questionnaire responses indicated that the study was feasible and acceptable with the majority (>50%) reporting <i>Agree</i> or <i>Strongly Agree</i> with positive <i>Net Favorability</i> [(<i>Agree</i> + <i>Strongly Agree</i>) - (<i>Disagree</i> + <i>Totally Disagree</i>)] in each of the domains (e.g., Fitbit use, ONC Roadmap use, completing longitudinal assessments, engaging in similar future study, study expectations). Improvements were seen across the majority of the mental HRQOL domains across all groups; even though underpowered, there were significant improvements in caregiver-specific aspects of HRQOL and anxiety and in depression and fatigue for children (ages 8-17 years), and a trend toward improvement in depression for children ages 8-17 years and in fatigue for adult patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study supports that mHealth technology may be a promising platform to provide HRQOL support for caregivers of pediatric patients with cancer. Importantly, the findings suggest that the study protocol was feasible, and participants were favorable to participate in future studies of this intervention alongside routine cancer care delivery.},

This study examined the effectiveness of a 24-week walking program based on social-cognitive determinants through mobile app for CVD risk reduction among female Korean-Chinese middle-aged workers.<h4>Methods</h4>This study used a parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited by distributing posters and flyers and randomly assigned to either the standard treatment (ST, n = 22) or enhanced treatment group (ET, n = 28). Participants were provided with a mobile app linked to Fitbit Alta for 24 weeks and instructed to walk at least 30 minutes five times a week and moderate-intensity physical activity. The ET group had additional interventions that enhanced social-cognitive determinants such as self-efficacy, social support. All participants were guided to voluntary physical activity during the 12-week maintenance period. Data were analyzed by the Mann Whitney U-test and a generalized estimating equation.<h4>Results</h4>There were significant between-group differences regarding the number of steps (B = 1.295, P < .001) and moderate physical activity time (OR = 6.396, P = .030) at week 12. ET group had significant changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (B = 10.522, P = .007), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (B = -16.178, P = .024), total cholesterol (B = -20.325, P = .039), fasting blood sugar (B = - 8.138, P = -.046).

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Lung transplantation is an established treatment option for persons with advanced lung disease. After transplantation, lung function typically returns to near normal levels, however exercise capacity remains low due to chronic deconditioning, limited physical function, and inactive lifestyles which undermine the intended benefits of the highly selective, resource-intensive transplant procedure. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended to improve fitness and activity tolerance, however due to multiple barriers, lung transplant recipients either never participate, or fail to complete, pulmonary rehabilitation programs.<h4>Purpose</h4>To describe the design of Lung Transplant Go (LTGO), a trial modified for the remote environment based on recommendations to preserve trial integrity during COVID. The aims are to evaluate a behavioral exercise intervention to improve physical function, physical activity, and blood pressure control in lung transplant recipients conducted safely and effectively using a telerehabilitation (telerehab) platform, and to explore the role of potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between LTGO and outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Single-site, 2-group randomized controlled trial with lung transplant recipients randomized 1:1 to either the LTGO intervention (a 2-phased, supervised, telerehab behavioral exercise program), or to enhanced usual care (activity tracking and monthly newsletters). All study activities, including intervention delivery, recruitment, consenting, assessment, and data collection, will be performed remotely.<h4>Conclusion</h4>If efficacious, this fully scalable and replicable telerehab intervention could be efficiently translated to reach large numbers of lung recipients to improve and sustain self-management of exercise habits by overcoming barriers to participation in existing, in-person pulmonary rehabilitation programs.},

This study compared exercise measurement from an in-person walk test; wearable activity tracker; and self-report at CR entry, completion (8-weeks) and follow-up (16-weeks). Forty patients beginning CR completed the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and wore Fitbit-Flex for four consecutive days including two weekend days. The sample mean age was 66 years; 67% were male. Increased exercise capacity at CR completion and follow-up was detected by a 6MWT change in mean distance (39 m and 42 m; p = 0.01, respectively). Increased PA participation at CR completion was detected by Fitbit-Flex mean change in step counts (1794; p = 0.01). Relative changes for Fitbit-Flex step counts and a 6MWT were consistent with previous research, demonstrating Fitbit-Flex's potential as an outcome measure. With four days of data, Fitbit-Flex had acceptable ICC values in measuring step counts and MVPA minutes. Fitbit-Flex steps and 6MWT meters are more responsive to changes in PA patterns following exposure to a cardiac rehabilitation program than Fitbit-Flex or PASE-estimated moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes. Fitbit-Flex step counts provide a useful additional measure for assessing PA outside of the CR setting and accounts for day-to-day variations. Two weekend days and two weekdays are needed for Fitbit-Flex to estimate PA levels more precisely.},

	Abstract = {The innovation of wearable devices is advancing rapidly. Activity monitors can be used to improve the total hip replacement (THR) patients' recovery process and reduce costs. This systematic review assessed the body-worn accelerometers used in studies to enhance the rehabilitation process and monitor THR patients. Electronic databases such as Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews library, CINAHL CompleteVR, Science Citation Index, and MedlineVR from January 2000 to January 2022 were searched. Due to inclusion criteria, fourteen eligible studies that utilised commercial wearable technology to monitor physical activity both before and after THR were identified. Their evidence quality was assessed with RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I. This study demonstrates that wearable device technology might be feasible to predict, monitor, and detect physical activity following THR. They could be used as a motivational tool to increase patients' mobility and enhance the recovery process. Also, wearable activity monitors could provide a better insight into the individual's activity level in contrast to subjective self-reported questionnaires. However, they have some limitations, and further evidence is needed to establish this technology as the primary device in THR rehabilitation.},

	Abstract = {The vINCI technology represents an innovative instrument developed specifically but not exclusively for older adults by technology researchers together with a medical team specialized in geriatrics and gerontology. It was designed to be independently and effortlessly used by older adults in the comfort and safety of their own environment. It is a modular and flexible platform that can integrate a large array of various sensors and can easily adapt to specific healthcare needs. The pilot study tested sensors and standardized instruments capable of evaluating several care-related parameters and of generating personalized feedback for the user dedicated to optimizing physical activity level, social interaction, and health-related quality of life. Moreover, the system was able to detect and signal events and health-related aspects that would require medical assistance. This paper presents how the innovative vINCI technology improves quality of life in older adults. This is evidenced by the results obtained following the clinical validation of the vINCI technology by older adults admitted to the Ana Aslan National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics (NIGG) in Bucharest.},

	Abstract = {Fitbit wearable devices provide users with objective data on their physical activity and sleep habits. However, little is known about how users develop their usage patterns and the key mechanisms underlying the development of such patterns. In this article, we report results from a longitudinal analysis of Fitbit usage behavior among a sample of college students. Survey and Fitbit data were collected from 692 undergraduates at the University of Notre Dame across two waves. We use a structural equation modeling strategy to examine the relationships among three dimensions of Fitbit usage behavior corresponding to three elements of the habit loop model: trust in the accuracy of Fitbit physical activity and sleep data (<i>cue</i>), intensity of Fitbit device use (<i>routine</i>), and adjustment of physical activity and sleep behaviors based on Fitbit data (<i>reward</i>). More than 75 percent of participants trusted the accuracy of Fitbit data and nearly half of the participants reported they adjusted their physical activities based on the data reported by their devices. Participants who trusted the Fitbit physical activity data also tended to trust the sleep data, and those who intensively used Fitbit devices tended to adjust both their physical activities and then sleep habits. Psychological states and traits such as depression, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism help predict multiple dimensions of Fitbit usage behaviors. However, we find little evidence that trust, Fitbit usage, or perceived adjustment of activity or sleep were associated with actual changes in levels of sleep and activity. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding when and how this new monitoring technology results in changes in people's behavior.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) during childhood and adolescence is crucial as it usually results in adequate PA levels in adulthood. Given the ubiquitous use of smartphones by adolescents, these devices may offer feasible means to reach young populations and deliver interventions aiming to increase PA participation and decrease sedentary time. To date, very few studies have reported smartphone-based interventions promoting PA for adolescents. In addition, most available fitness apps do not include the latest evidence-based content.<h4>Objective</h4>This paper described the systematic development of a behavior change, theory-informed Mobile App for Physical Activity intervention with personalized prompts for adolescents aged 16 to 18 years. The within-subject trial results provided the first evidence of the general effectiveness of the intervention based on the outcomes step count, sedentary time, and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes. The effectiveness of the intervention component personalized PA prompt was also assessed.<h4>Methods</h4>A 4-week within-subject trial with 18 healthy adolescents aged 16 to 18 years was conducted (mean age 16.33, SD 0.57 years). After the baseline week, the participants used the Mobile App for Physical Activity intervention (Fitbit fitness tracker+app), which included a daily personalized PA prompt delivered via a pop-up notification. A paired 1-tailed t test was performed to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Change-point analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of a personalized PA prompt 30 and 60 minutes after prompt delivery.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that the intervention significantly reduced sedentary time in adolescents during the first week of the trial (t<sub>17</sub>=-1.79; P=.04; bootstrapped P=.02). This trend, although remaining positive, diminished over time. Our findings indicate that the intervention had no effect on metabolic equivalent of task-based MVPA minutes, although the descriptive increase may give reason for further investigation. Although the results suggested no overall change in heart rate-based MVPA minutes, the results from the change-point analyses suggest that the personalized PA prompts significantly increased heart rate per minute during the second week of the study (t<sub>16</sub>=1.84; P=.04; bootstrapped P=.04). There were no significant increases in participants' overall step count; however, the personalized PA prompts resulted in a marginally significant increase in step counts per minute in the second week of the study (t<sub>17</sub>=1.35; P=.09; bootstrapped P=.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of the trial provide preliminary evidence of the benefit of the Mobile App for Physical Activity intervention for modest yet significant reductions in participants' sedentary time and the beneficial role of personalized PA prompts. These results also provide further evidence of the benefits and relative efficacy of personalized activity suggestions for inclusion in smartphone-based PA interventions. This study provides an example of how to guide the development of smartphone-based mobile health PA interventions for adolescents.},

It is possible that incentives, combined with health coaching and daily feedback on goal success, may increase program efficacy; however, such programs have not yet been tested with adolescents with overweight and obesity.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week, incentive-based, mobile health physical activity program with text-based health coaching, goal setting, and self-monitoring for adolescents with overweight or obesity. Program adherence and changes in tracked physical activity (ie, steps and active minutes while wearing a Fitbit [Google LLC]), body mass, and body fat are assessed.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 28 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years with a BMI ≥90th percentile participated in the program. Of the 28 participants, 2 (7%) were lost to follow-up; thus, data from 26 (93%) participants were used in analyses.<h4>Results</h4>Participant-reported acceptability was high, with all mean ratings of text-based coaching, Fitbit use, and the overall program being >5 on a 7-point scale. In addition, 85% (23/26) of participants reported that they would like to continue to wear the Fitbit. Program adherence was also high, as participants wore the Fitbit on 91.1% (SD 12.6%) of days on average and met their weekly goals for an average of 7 (SD 3.5) of 11 possible weeks. There were no demographic (ie, sex, age, and baseline body mass) differences in the percentage of days participants wore their Fitbit. Across the 12-week study, there were significant improvements in tracked daily active minutes (P=.006) and steps (P<.001) and significant pre- to posttest improvements in body fat percentage (P=.04).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The pilot program improved adolescent physical activity and physical health. A larger factorial design trial with adaptive daily goals may clarify the role of each program component in driving physical activity.},

	Abstract = {The market for wrist-worn devices is growing at previously unheard-of speeds. A consequence of their fast commercialization is a lack of adequate studies testing their accuracy on varied populations and pursuits. To provide an understanding of wearable sensors for sports medicine, the present study examined heart rate (HR) measurements of four popular wrist-worn devices, the (Fitbit Charge (FB), Apple Watch (AW), Tomtom runner Cardio (TT), and Samsung G2 (G2)), and compared them with gold standard measurements derived by continuous electrocardiogram examination (ECG). Eight athletes participated in a comparative study undergoing maximal stress testing on a cycle ergometer or a treadmill. We analyzed 1,286 simultaneous HR data pairs between the tested devices and the ECG. The four devices were reasonably accurate at the lowest activity level. However, at higher levels of exercise intensity the FB and G2 tended to underestimate HR values during intense physical effort, while the TT and AW devices were fairly reliable. Our results suggest that HR estimations should be considered cautiously at specific intensities. Indeed, an effective intervention is required to register accurate HR readings at high-intensity levels (above 150 bpm). It is important to consider that even though none of these devices are certified or sold as medical or safety devices, researchers must nonetheless evaluate wrist-worn wearable technology in order to fully understand how HR affects psychological and physical health, especially under conditions of more intense exercise.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Monitoring food intake and physical activity (PA) using tracking applications may support behavior change. However, few longitudinal studies identify the characteristics of young adults who track their behavior, findings that could be useful in designing tracking-related interventions. Our objective was to identify predictors of past-year food and PA tracking among young adults.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were available for 676 young adults participating in the ongoing longitudinal Nicotine Dependence in Teens Study. Potential predictors were measured in 2017-2020 at age 31, and past-year food and PA tracking were measured in 2021-2022 at age 34. Each potential predictor was studied in a separate multivariable logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, and educational attainment.<h4>Results</h4>One third (37%) of participants reported past-year PA tracking; 14% reported past-year food, and 10% reported both. Nine and 11 of 41 potential predictors were associated with food and PA tracking, respectively. Compensatory behaviors after overeating, trying to lose weight, self-report overweight, reporting a wide variety of exercise behaviors, and pressure to lose weight predicted both food and PA tracking.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Food and PA tracking are relatively common among young adults. If the associations observed herein between compensatory behavior after overeating and tracking (among other observed associations) are replicated and found to be causal, caution may need to be exercised in making "blanket" recommendations to track food intake and/or PA to all young adults seeking behavior change.},

Prior studies have used technology to bridge barriers but have been unable to extensively assess the impact of the digital therapeutic on real-world patient experience and multidimensional outcomes. Among patients with insomnia, our aim is to determine the impact of a prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) (PEAR-003b, FDA-authorised as Somryst; herein called PDT) that provides mobile-delivered CBT-I on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and healthcare utilisation.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We are conducting a pragmatically designed, prospective, multicentre randomised controlled trial that leverages Hugo, a unique patient-centred health data-aggregating platform for data collection and patient follow-up from Hugo Health. A total of 100 participants with insomnia from two health centres will be enrolled onto the Hugo Health platform, provided with a linked Fitbit (Inspire 2) to track activity and then randomised 1:1 to receive (or not) the PDT for mobile-delivered CBT-I (Somryst). The primary outcome is a change in the insomnia severity index score from baseline to 9-week postrandomisation. Secondary outcomes include healthcare utilisation, health utility scores and clinical outcomes; change in sleep outcomes as measured with sleep diaries and a change in individual PROs including depressive symptoms, daytime sleepiness, health status, stress and anxiety. For those allocated to the PDT, we will also assess engagement with the PDT.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The Institutional Review Boards at Yale University and the Mayo Clinic have approved the trial protocol. This trial will provide important data to patients, clinicians and policymakers about the impact of the PDT device delivering CBT-I on PROs, clinical outcomes and healthcare utilisation. Findings will be disseminated to participants, presented at professional meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>NCT04909229.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Prostate cancer survivors (PCS) experience long-term side effects beyond treatment such as fatigue, depression and anxiety. Quality and engaging supportive care programs are needed to reduce these chronic and debilitating effects. Independent of physical activity (PA), high volumes of sedentary behavior (SB) are associated with chronic disease-related risk factors and poorer cancer-specific quality of life (QoL). Simultaneously increasing PA and decreasing SB may be an effective health promotion strategy. Given that PCS may face several barriers to engaging in supervised programs, there is a need to develop and assess the efficacy of interventions that employ distance-based approaches for behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of a 12-week intervention (Fitbit + behavioral counselling) vs. Fitbit-only control group in reducing SB among PCS. Secondary outcomes include light-intensity PA, QoL, motivational outcomes, and patient satisfaction.<h4>Methods</h4>This two-armed, randomized controlled trial will recruit inactive PCS (stage I-IV) across Canada who self-report engaging in >8 hours/day of SB. Participants will be randomized to the intervention (n=60; Fitbit and behavioral support) or active control group (n=60; Fitbit-only). The intervention consists of the use of a Fitbit and a series of six behavioral support sessions (two group, four individual) to aid PCS in gradually replacing SB with light-intensity PA by increasing their daily step counts to 3,000 steps above their baseline values. The Fitbit-only control condition will receive a Fitbit and public health PA resources. The primary outcome is change in SB measured objectively using activPAL inclinometers. All secondary outcomes will be measured via self-report, except for PA which will be measuring using Fitbits. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6-month post-intervention.<h4>Discussion</h4>Reducing SB and increasing light-intensity PA plays an important, yet often undervalued role in the health and well-being of PCS. This study will create a unique distance-based platform that can be used by clinical and community-based organizations as a low-cost, supportive care tool to improve health outcomes for PCS.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05214937 .

Study procedures were fully remote via live video. Quantitative analyses explored feasibility and acceptability markers and within-group improvements in outcomes. Qualitative analyses were primarily deductive using the Framework Method.<h4>Results</h4>AB-F met a priori set feasibility benchmarks, similar to our in-person pilot. Participation in AB-F was associated with preliminary signals of improvement in multimodal physical function, emotional function (anxiety), cognitive function, pain intensity, and coping (e.g., pain self-efficacy, catastrophizing). Participation in HEP was associated with smaller or negligible improvements.

This mixed-method study evaluated a smart home technology intervention for individuals within this population as well as providing health care providers with health monitoring capabilities. The study recruited 13 participants who were offered a smartphone, a touchscreen monitor, and health devices, including smartwatches, weigh scales, and automated medication dispensers. Healthcare providers were able to track health device data, which were synchronized with the Lawson Integrated DataBase. Participants completed interviews at baseline as well as at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Focus groups with participants and care providers were conducted separately at 6-month and 12-month time points. As the sample size was too small for meaningful statistical inference, only descriptive statistics were presented. However, the qualitative analyses revealed improvements in physical and mental health, as well as enhanced communication with care providers and friends/family. Technical difficulties and considerations are addressed. Ethics analyses revealed advancement in equity and fairness, while policy analyses revealed plentiful opportunities for informing policymakers. The economic costs are also discussed. Further studies and technological interventions are recommended to explore and expand upon in-home technologies that can be easily implemented into the living environment.},

The association between accelerometer-measured physical activity and cross-sectional SD-OCT macular thickness was then assessed in 8862 eyes from 6152 participants available for analysis in the UK Biobank who had SD-OCT, ophthalmic, comorbidity, and demographic data.<h4>Results</h4>Greater physical activity was associated with slower rates of macular GCIPL thinning in the PROGRESSA study (beta = 0.07 µm/y/SD; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.13; P = 0.003) after adjustment for ophthalmic, demographic and systemic predictors of macular thinning. This association persisted in subanalyses of participants characterized as glaucoma suspects (beta = 0.09 µm/y/SD; 95% CI, 0.03-0.15; P = 0.005). Participants in the upper tertile (greater than 10,524 steps/d) exhibited a 0.22-µm/y slower rate of macular GCIPL thinning than participants in the lower tertile (fewer than 6925 steps/d): -0.40 ± 0.46 µm/y versus -0.62 ± 0.55 µm/y (P = 0.003).

My Diabetes My Way (MDMW) is an electronic personal health record/educational platform available to people with diabetes in Scotland. This study aims to assess user experience with respect to demographic subgroups, examine effectiveness of previous improvements made to the platform and inform its ongoing development.<h4>Methods</h4>All active MDMW users (22,665) were invited to take part in a questionnaire combining Likert scale and free-response items relating to system utility. Likert responses were used to generate a 'utility score'. This was used in regression analyses to determine predictors of system utility scoring. Free-response answers were analysed thematically and themes were generated.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 4713 (21%) MDMW users responded to the questionnaire. Most agreed that MDMW helps them to track changes over time, prepare for face-to-face consultations, remember information discussed in consultations and reduced the need to contact their general practitioner. Free-response answers showed that users valued earlier enhancements made to the site (e.g. linking Fitbit data), and highlighted areas needing further improvement. Evidence of the 'digital divide' was seen in respondent demographics, and some users mentioned 'lack of digital skills' as a barrier to engaging with the platform.<h4>Conclusions</h4>User experience of MDMW was positive. Users agreed with statements that MDMW facilitates diabetes self management. Several areas of potential improvement were identified, including linking more wearable device data, and assisting/directing users to gain the digital skills required to engage fully with MDMW.},
