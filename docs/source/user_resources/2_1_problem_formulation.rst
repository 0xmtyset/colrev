Step 1: Problem formulation
==================================

TODO

- problem formulation phase, review type classifications (including references), ... coherence
- working hypothesis: differences between review types primarily manifest in the data stage (in the other steps, it is mostly a question of parameters)
- mention settings (but do not display complete settings.json, which is too long?)
- TBD: mention the formulation of the scope and search strategy? (exploratory vs confirmatory searches, boolean operators...)
- Include link to the available review types in the init page
- Indicate that different forms of `data <2_6_data/data.html>`data analysis are activated by the selected review types  (per default)
