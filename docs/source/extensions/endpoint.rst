Endpoint
==================================

The :program:`colrev_cml_endpoint` extension is aimed at making it easy to integrate other tools by operating endtpoints that support the export and loading of data.
For example, EndPoint supports the collaboration with Endnote (and other reference mangers) or ASReview for the prescreen.

TODO : provide examples
