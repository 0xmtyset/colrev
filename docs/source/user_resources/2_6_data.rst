Step 6: Data extraction and synthesis
---------------------------------------------

The last step corresponds to the data extraction, analysis and synthesis activities.
Depending on the type of review, this may involve a structured (deductive) data extraction, quality, risk-of-bias assessments and meta-analytic regressions, emergent (inductive) content analyses, manuscripts (involving PRISMA flow charts and sample profiles), as well as additional reporting items (full samples).

    - a manuscript-based synthesis
        - structured data extraction (diffs are displayed using `daff <https://github.com/paulfitz/daff>`_ or the `browser extension <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-csv-diff/ngpdjmibpbemokfbmapemhpbmgacebhg/>`_)

    To select the data format, please consult the best practices for different `types of reviews <./best_practices.html#types-of-literature-reviews>`_.


The data extraction and synthesis step corresponds to a single operation:
