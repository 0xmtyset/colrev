  abstract = {A system M tangent to a plant P at the nominal equilibrium is a nicely nonlinear model of P if it is rigorously linearizable by output feedback. The general structure of a nicely nonlinear modelling problem can be outlined as follows. Given: i) a class of parametrized nonlinear models, and a feasible parameter set, such that any feasible model is nicely nonlinear, ii) a family of significant operating conditions (input-output pairs) of P, minimize, over the feasible parameter set, a nonnegative misfit function (relative to the considered family of operating conditions) between the nicely nonlinear model and the plant The purpose of the present paper is to present an algorithm for the semi-infinite nonlinear programming problem resulting from a particular instance of the general setting above.},

The information utilized was obtained from the Medline data base, searching the journal Diabetes for a set of keywords appearing in the diabetes field from 1974 to 1994, An analysis is given of the research in diabetes over the last 21 years based on the keyword information, A measure was obtained for all the keywords considered, and the areas of research identified by the respective keywords were analyzed. At the same time, this analysis provided measures for each year, as well as a description of the `'research trends'' in diabetes, Insulin had the highest measure of the keywords searched, followed by Diabetes mellitus experimental. The year 1991 accounted for most keywords and 1978 fewest, Diabetes mellitus noninsulin dependent, Diabetes mellitus experimental, and Diabetes ketoacidosis were the keywords that misfit the model, and 1974, 1977, and 1991 were the misfitting years, The `'information underlying keywords'' is a latent variable, and the Rasch model is a useful instrument for measuring that variable. This methodology allows how research has been developing over the last 21 years to be described according to the keywords and their related fields.},

  abstract = {Before software project managers can enhance productivity and satisfaction of the software project team member, the effect of task characteristics, goal orientations, and coordination strategies on design and coding-task outcomes must be understood. A research model, which suggests that task interdependence, goal conflict, and coordination strategies significantly affect productivity and satisfaction associated with software design and coding activities, is presented. Issues such as contingency/design misfit, conflicting contingencies, and the extent of deviation to theoretically prescribed coordination mechanisms applied to contingencies are used to make predictions on productivity and process satisfaction. A 2x2x2 factorial experiment was utilized. Overall, projects characterized by low task interdependence exhibited greater productivity than projects with high task interdependence. Also, in general, organic coordination was more productive than mechanistic coordination. There was also a significant interaction between task interdependence and coordination strategy. Low goal conflict and organic coordination each lead to greater process satisfaction. Productivity results for the goal conflict manipulation was opposite to the hypothesized direction. Unconflicted contingencies addressed with consistent coordination and partially conflicted contingencies, regardless of the coordination used, exhibited significant gains in productivity. In comparison, unconflicted contingencies with inconsistent coordination and conflicted contingencies, regardless of the coordination applied, resulted in lower productivity. This suggests that there are instances where multiple contingencies, which warrant the use of different coordination strategies, can be adequately addressed with a specific coordination strategy.},

Quantile regression plays an important role in many data mining applications, including outlier-robust exploratory analysis in gene selection. In addition, the sparsity consideration in quantile regression enables the exploration of the entire conditional distribution of the response variable given the predictors and therefore yields a more comprehensive view of the important predictors. We propose a generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm for variable selection, taking the misfit loss to be either the traditional quantile loss or a smooth version we call quantile Huber, and compare the resulting greedy approaches with convex sparsity-regularized formulations. We apply a recently proposed interior point methodology to efficiently solve all formulations, provide theoretical guarantees of consistent estimation, and demonstrate the performance of our approach using empirical studies of simulated and genomic datasets.},

  abstract  = {UKM2 is an intelligence test developed to screen gifted students in Malaysia. This study aims at identifying the reliability and validity of the UKM2 using the item analysis method. 497 undergraduate students randomly selected from a Malaysian local university, were chosen as respondents. The test was administered via on-line. The Items Response Theory (IRT) is used with the application of Rasch model of measurement for the analysis procedure. The scoring of UKM2 are dichotomus and partial credit models based. The result of study shows that all the subtests have the reliability values of Cronbach's alpha>0.80 (0.86-0.99) and separation indexes>2 (2.51-11.94) with the number of stratas 3-16. All the subtests are unidimensionals except for Block Design and Comprehension subtests. The study confirms that UKM2 is a multidimensional test with four correlated dimensions which are Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Working Memory Index (WMI), Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) and Processing Speed Index (PSI). Research shows that 221 are fit items (MNSQ 0.5-1.5), 69 items are overfit and 80 items are misfits, using the Infit and Outfit statistics. Most of the misfit items are from the Symbol Search subtests, while most of the overfit items are from Arithmetic, Letter-Number Sequencing and Picture Completion subtests. The study suggests for the elimination of the overfit items and for the revision or removal of the misfit items in the UKM2 intelligence test. The good psychometrics properties of the items from the analysis of the study could be used for the banking purposes in the adult version of UKM2.},

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data were gathered using contextual inquiry observations with 21 workers at the London office of an international law firm. The analysis uses CASSM (″Concept-based Analysis of Surface and Structural Misfits″), a usability evaluation method structured around identifying mismatches, or ``misfits″, between user-concepts and concepts represented within a system. Findings - Participants were frequently overwhelmed by e-mail alerts, and a key requirement is to support efficient interaction. Several misfits, which act as barriers to efficient reviewing and follow-on activities, are demonstrated. These relate to a lack of representation of key user-concepts at the interface and/or within the system, including alert items and their properties, source documents, ``back-story″, primary sources, content categorisations and user collections. Research limitations/implications - Given these misfits, a set of requirements is derived to improve the efficiency with which users can achieve key outcomes with current-awareness information as these occur within a professional work environment. Originality/value - The findings will be of interest to current-awareness providers. The approach is relevant to information interaction researchers interested in deriving design requirements from naturalistic studies.},

Responding to the variety of graph data and algorithms, many parallel and distributed graph-processing systems exist. However, until now these platforms use a static model of deployment: they only run on a pre-defined set of machines. This raises many conceptual and pragmatic issues, including misfit with the highly dynamic nature of graph processing, and could lead to resource waste and high operational costs. In contrast, in this work we explore a dynamic, elastic model of deployment. To conduct an in-depth elasticity study of distributed graph processing, we build a prototype, JoyGraph, which is the first such system that implements complex, policy-based, and fine-grained elasticity. Using the state-of-the-art LDBC Graphalytics benchmark and the SPEC Cloud Group's elasticity metrics, we show the benefits of elasticity in graph processing: improved resource utilization, and aligned operation-workload dynamicity. Furthermore, we explore the cost of elasticity in graph processing. We identify a key drawback: although elasticity does not degrade application throughput, graph-processing workloads are sensitive to data movement while leasing or releasing resources.},

Many now agree that achieving enterprise systems benefits is complex, cumbersome, risky and expensive. Furthermore many ERP projects do not fully achieve expectations. This paper takes a critical lens to the prospect of a firm achieving enterprise systems' benefits and presents the findings of a case study that examines the underlying managerial and organizational reasons of one multi-national enterprise for, at least, postponing ERP implementation. It reveals a rich picture of implementation motivators, inhibitors and the perceived and real benefits of enterprise systems.},

OSM focuses on the structure of the domain in question and the devices which are applied to that domain, in order to reason about the quality of fit between the two. This analysis shows how OSM can be used to identify misfits between domain (here incidents, ambulance calls and real-time call processing by ambulance service staff) and device (the computer aided dispatch system) in real work settings. We show how OSM can aid additional reasoning about the way in which a new or proposed computer system can both support and enhance existing work structures. The analysis presented here also yields important insights into both the still-developing OSM and the structure of emergency medical dispatch systems.},

  abstract  = {The sensitivities of a simple zero-dimensional model which describes the major nutrient processes and the oxygen concentration in the tidal influenced Elbe estuary were studied. For this purpose the Integrated Modeling and Analysis System (IMAS) was used. By using the adjoint model, the impact of the initial model parameters on their counterparts after a period of ten days were studied. By doing this it was determined, which model compartment is acting on the other ones and which is not doing so. By minimizing the misfit between the observational data and their model counterparts (quadratic cost function), it is possible to estimate the the optimal values of the parameters used in the model. The Hessian matrix of the cost function offers the opportunity to determine the posteriori uncertainty of the model parameters. Analyzing the eigenmodes of the Hessian yields those linear combinations of the model parameters, which are most effectively controlled by data, i.e. for which the posteriori confidence interval is significantly smaller than the prior confidence interval.},

The key to realizing the benefits is the sharing of information among members of supply chain network via SCM systems. We survey more than 200 firms and the results show that firms tend to adopt SCM systems if they fit their major business processes and that there is a network externality to adopting such systems. Moreover, the aforementioned two forces interact with each other as the benefits of SCM system will be amplified in the supply chain network as the number of system users increases. Likewise, the problems of SCM system caused by the misfit between SCM system and major business processes will be exacerbated as the number of users in the network increases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Software developers face a constant barrage of innovations designed to improve the development environment. Yet stress/strain among software developers has been steadily increasing and is at an all-time high, while their productivity is often questioned. Why, if these innovations are meant to improve the environment, are developers more stressed and less productive than they should be? Using a combination of cognitive style and person-environment fit theories as the theoretical lens, this study examines one potential source of stress/strain and productivity impediment among software developers. Specifically, this paper examines the fit between the preferred cognitive style of a software developer and his or her perception of the cognitive style required by the job environment, and the effect of that fit on stress/strain and performance. Data collected from a field study of 123 (object-oriented) software developers suggest that performance decreases and stress increases as this gap between cognitive styles becomes wider. Using surface response methodology, the precise fit relationship is modeled. The interaction of the developer and the environment provides explanatory power above and beyond either of the factors separately, suggesting that studies examining strain and performance of developers should explicitly consider and measure the cognitive style fit between the software developer and the software development environment. In practice, managers can use the results to help recognize misfit, its consequences, and the appropriate interventions (such as training or person/task matching).},

  abstract = {Large-scale controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) three-dimensional (3D) geophysical imaging is now receiving considerable attention for electrical-conductivity mapping of potential offshore oil and gas reservoirs. To cope with the typically large computational requirements of the 3D CSEM imaging problem, our strategies exploit computational parallelism and optimized finite-difference meshing. We report on an imaging experiment utilizing 32,768 tasks (and processors) on the IBM Blue Gene/L (TM) (BG/L) supercomputer at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. Over a 24-hour period, we were able to image a large-scale marine CSEM field dataset that previously required more than 4 months of computing time on distributed clusters utilizing 1,024 tasks on an InfiniBand((R)) fabric. The total initial data-fitting errors (i.e., ``misfits″) could be decreased by 67% within 72 completed inversion iterations, indicating the existence Of an electrically resistive region in the southern survey area below a depth of 1,500 m underneath the seafloor. The major part of the residual misfit stems from transmitter-parallel receiver components that have an offset from the transmitter sail line (broadside configuration). Modeling confirms that improved broadside data fits can be achieved by considering anisotropic electrical conductivities. While delivering a satisfactory gross-scale image for the depths of interest, the experiment provides important evidence,for the necessity of discriminating between horizontal and vertical conductivities for maximally consistent 3D CSEM inversions.},

  abstract = {Corporate involvement in open source software (OSS) communities has increased substantially in recent years. Often this takes the form of company employees devoting their time to contribute code to the efforts of projects in these communities. Ideology has traditionally served to motivate, coordinate, and guide volunteer contributions to OSS communities. As employees represent an increasing proportion of the participants in OSS communities, the role of OSS ideology in guiding their commitment and code contributions is unknown. In this research, we argue that OSS ideology misfit has important implications for companies and the OSS communities to which their employees contribute, since their engagement in such communities is not necessarily voluntary. We conceptualize two different types of misfit: OSS ideology under-fit, whereby an employee embraces an OSS ideology more than their coworkers or OSS community do, and OSS ideology over-fit, whereby an employee perceives that their coworkers or OSS community embrace the OSS ideology more strongly than the employee does. To develop a set of hypotheses about the implications of these two types of misfit for employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community, we draw on self-determination theory. We test the hypotheses in a field study of 186 employees who participate in an OSS community. We find that OSS ideology under-fit impacts the company and the community in the same way: it decreases employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community. In contrast, we find that OSS ideology over-fit increases commitment to the company but decreases commitment to the OSS community. Finally, we find that employees' commitment to their company reinforces the impact of their commitment to the OSS community in driving ongoing code contributions. This provides a holistic view of OSS ideology and its impacts among an increasingly pervasive yet understudied type of participant in OSS research. It provides insights for companies that are considering assigning their employees to work in OSS communities as well as for OSS communities that are partnering with these companies.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful method to reconstruct the properties of the subsurface media. However, the standard FWI is a non-unique and ill-posed inversion problem, which requires proper techniques to avoid cycle skipping phenomena. Sufficient low-frequencies in the observed data and a good initial model are helpful to mitigate cycle skipping problem, but they are hard to be provided in real cases. Therefore, to reduce the non-linearity and improve the convergence of FWI, we developed a novel approach inspired by using the convolutional neural network to mitigate the cycle skipping problem. We use the 1-dimentional (1-D) convolution kernels of different lengths to convolve each seismic trace of the synthetic and observed data to extract the different features of each time sample, and then we use the Sigmoid function to encode each time sample of the synthetic and observed data according to the polarity of the features. By comparing the coding similarity for the time sample of the synthetic and observed data at the corresponding time, we can identify which part of the synthetic data is well matched with the observed data and which part is mismatched. For the mismatched synthetic data, we attenuate them to reduce their interference on the gradient, thereby the cycle skipping problem can be mitigated. In this case, we use the global-correlation misfit function which behaves better in mitigating the interference of the incorrect amplitude information and highlighting the phase information with weaker non-linearity. In addition, the convolution coding and amplitude attenuation-based method has a strong anti-noise capability and can be combined with the encoded multisource scheme to save the computational costs. Marmousi model tests demonstrate that convolution coding and amplitude attenuation-based FWI behaves better than the standard FWI in generating convergent inverted result.},

  abstract = {Rehabilitation of control systems or implementation of Advanced Process Control (APC) in any large scale industrial installation poses several challenges. First of all, the implementation process has to meet stringent safety regulations. Moreover, it has to minimize normal production violation. All human, technology and control system risks need to be identified and a mitigation plan has to be prepared. Once the implementation limitations are fulfilled the installation requires to be prepared. The plant needs to be comprehensively assessed. All APC project related aspects, like control system or process instrumentation must be reviewed. Furthermore existing installation performance has to be measured for further justification of project results. The paper presents authorial assessment methodology aiming at the installation preparation before APC implementation. It is obvious that any supervisory control helps only when the underlying process, infrastructure and regulatory base control operates properly. Any performance malfunctioning within plant equipment or base control logic misfit limits, even the most sophisticated APC. The paper presents developed and practically adopted comprehensive multicriteria assessment procedure, which prepares the large scale chemical installation for APC supervisory control upgrade. Proposed procedure is accompanied with identified implementation risks and their mitigation plan.},

  abstract = {The use of information systems in organisations presents one of the early signs of success. Hundreds of studies have generated a wealth of knowledge on systems use across a broad range of technologies and theoretical approaches. However, new types of technologies and organisations continue to pose challenges to systems use. The case of open systems that are offered to users on a voluntary basis presents one of those challenges for two reasons: 1) the systems are open in the sense that they could be configured in many ways depending on users finding use cases and possible applications; 2) the system use is voluntary and hence there is no organisational push. They bring users' choice and active finding of use cases to the centre of their success. This study questions why and how users choose to engage (or not to engage) with open technology on a voluntary basis and how and why its use options and potential unfold? It examines a longitudinal case study (1994-2012) on the voluntary use of telemedicine. The findings reveal that users' perception of open technology in a voluntary setting is formed through a continuous interplay between users' technology mental models, professional identity, institutional traditions and arrangements and work practices. If perceived to be in contradiction with professional identity, institutional traditions and arrangements or work practices, users' technology mental models are fixated on the misfit and the misfit is thereby reinforced. Hence, users do not try to find use cases or think of possible applications. However, institutional entrepreneurs could break this self-fulfilling prophecy by influencing both the technology mental models of users and the institutional arrangements.},

  abstract = {Seismology has changed character since 50 years ago when the full wavefield could be determined. Partial differential equations (PDE) started to be used in the inverse process of finding properties of the interior of the earth. In this paper, we will review earlier techniques focusing on Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which is a large-scale non-convex PDE constrained optimization problem. The minimization of the objective function is usually coupled with the adjoint state method, which also includes the solution to an adjoint wave equation. The least-squares (L-2) norm is the conventional objective function measuring the difference between simulated and measured data, but it often results in the minimization trapped in local minima. One way to mitigate this is by selecting another misfit function with better convexity properties. Here we propose using the quadratic Wasserstein metric (W-2) as a new misfit function in FWI. The optimal map defining W-2 can be computed by solving a Monge-Ampere equation. Theorems pointing to the advantages of using optimal transport over L-2 norm will be discussed, and several large-scale computational examples will be presented.},

  abstract  = {To remain competitive, SMEs rely on technologies that automate support for their operations. Although an increasing number of SMEs use ERP systems, one of the major challenges is the selection of a software that fully meets their business needs. ERP systems generally come as standardized software packages. They are designed to fit generic rather than enterprise-specific requirements. Thus, mutual alignments of business and IT are essential to ensure an implementation project's success. However, many organizational change efforts involving the introduction of new technologies fail due to the work-force's resistance towards changes in their workflows, business processes, and technology they use. These so-called technochange situations require appropriate solutions that are complete and implementable. Thus, changes to business and IT must be complementary and organization-enterprise system misfits must be minimized. Following the paradigm of design science research, this contribution addresses technochange in ERP projects by assessing the organization-enterprise system fit during ERP selection. Applying a process fit perspective, organizational process models can be compared to ERP reference models using measures of business process similarity. In an experiment, we illustrate how ERP systems can be distinguished and ranked by their process features, positively influencing organizational fit and the likelihood of an ERP project's success.},

  abstract  = {Enterprise Resource Planning systems that provide a packaged solution to data management problems across an enterprise are widely implemented in modern organisations. Ongoing efforts to deliver productive outcomes from implementing ERPs have ensured that this is an area of great interest to IS researchers and practitioners. This paper investigates the notion of `fit' of ERP to organisation with respect to the integration of data, processes, systems and practices implicit in an ERP and the coupling between an organisation's subsystems. The outcomes of an intensive case study of a challenged ERP implementation highlight some of the risks of introducing an ERP into an organisation which can be described as a loosely-coupled system.},

In spite of having merit, many papers are rejected from the desk merely because they are a misfit to the scope of the journal. However, this phenomena costs a considerable time of both the editors and the authors. In this work, we present an investigation towards automation of desk rejection for out-of-scope submissions. We model the problem as a binary classification decision of an article being within scope or outside. We carry our experiments on six different Elsevier Computer Science journals. Our approach based on supervised machine learning outperforms a state-of-the-art by a wide margin in terms of accuracy (at least similar to 8%). We believe that our proposed method is generic, and with requisite set-up could be applied to articles of other journals. An appropriate system developed with our features could also help prospective authors to check beforehand whether they are submitting to the right venue.},

Their functionality is not specifically tailored to particular companies implementing these systems. Differences between provided functionality and company's needs are identified using fit-gap analysis. The paper develops a novel optimization model for fit-gap analysis. The model yields an optimal gaps resolution strategy, which defines type and timing of customizations made to resolve the gaps and decisions are made with respect to the vendor's software evolution roadmap. Thus, the model highlights trade-offs between inhouse customization and adoption of standard features yet to be released. The optimization results are analysed depending on the company's customization preferences and an application example is also provided. The model allows for understanding and evaluation of relationships between the company implementing the ERP system and the vendor of the ERP system.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in information technologies (IT) have powered the merger of online and offline retail channels into one single platform. Modern consumers frequently switch between online and offline channels when they navigate through various stages of the decision journey, motivating multichannel sellers to develop omni-channel strategies that optimize their overall profit. This study examines consumers' cross-channel search behavior of ``pseudo-showrooming,″ or the consumer behavior of inspecting one product at a seller's physical store before buying a related but different product at the same seller's online store, and investigates how such consumer behavior allows a multichannel seller to achieve better coordination between its online and offline arms through optimal product placement strategies. We develop a stylized model in which a multichannel firm offers a product line consisting of two horizontally differentiated products. Consumers are uncertain about the true value of either product. A consumer's uncertainty regarding a particular product's value is fully resolved after inspecting that product in person, and can also be partially resolved after inspecting the other related product. By selling only one product through the dual channel and the other product through the online channel exclusively, the firm induces consumer pseudoshow-rooming for the online exclusive product. Our analysis shows that this product placement strategy generates a greater profit than selling both products through the dual channel, if the fit probability of individual products and consumers' cost for returning a misfit product are both in the intermediate range. Moreover, we find that over a large parameter region, consumers also enjoy a greater total surplus under the firm's product placement strategy that induces consumer pseudo-showrooming. Furthermore, we find that the firm garners the most benefit from inducing consumer pseudo-showrooming by selling the higher-quality product or the higher-demand product through the online channel exclusively. Collectively, our study offers a compelling demand-side justification of the commonly witnessed practice among multichannel sellers to offer products online exclusively when offline selling is feasible.},

We propose the adaptive multiagent system Amadeus whose goal is to learn from users' actions and contexts how to perform actions on behalf of the users in similar contexts. However, considering the possible changes of users preferences, a previously learnt behaviour may become misfit. So, Amadeus must be able to observe if its actions on the system are contradicted by the users or not, without requiring any explicit feedback. The aim of this paper is to present the introspection capabilities of Amadeus in order to detect users contradictions and to self-adapt its behaviour at runtime. These mechanisms are then evaluated through a case study.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the choice of interoperability approach for the provision of disaster management systems (DMS) when resources are distributed across districts, and in times of disaster resources can be shared. The degree to which sharing (a spillover) can be coordinated efficiently depends on resource interoperability. In this public sector setting, we model the provisioning of DMS as the choice between interoperability approaches; in decreasing order of centralization they are integrated, unified, and federated. A unique feature of our setting is that the interoperability approach is a collective decision by districts. Districts choose their own DMS resources and interoperability effort, and face different interoperability efficiency and technology misfit costs depending on the interoperability approach. We find that any approach can be an equilibrium depending on interoperability efficiency, and that when the social optimum deviates from the equilibrium the socially optimal approach is more centralized. When subsidies and taxes are implemented, the socially optimal interoperability approach can be achieved with budget balance. When only subsidies can be used, the socially optimal approach can be achieved but only under certain interoperability efficiency and misfit cost conditions is there a net social gain. Having an initial level of interoperability causes the equilibrium interoperability approach to shift toward a less centralized one. Our results generalize to other settings characterized by interoperability concerns, collective decisions, and spillovers.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a theoretical calculation of misfit dislocation and strain relaxation in compositionally step graded InxGa1xN grown on GaN using the total dislocation energy at each interface. The results also compared with uniform layer of In0.17Ga0.83N and In0.14Ga0.86N grown differently on GaN. Due to having residual strain and a step increase in indium composition a lower misfit strain in upper layers and hence larger critical thickness at each interface has been reported. These effects significantly reduced the misfit dislocations from 2.6x 10(5) cm(-1) to 9.5x 10(4) cm(-1) in step graded In0.14Ga0.86N(500nm)/In0.09Ga0.91N(100nm)/In0.05Ga0.95N(100nm)/GaN layers instead of a uniform In0.14Ga0.86N(700nm)/GaN. A small residual strain of 0.0007 after 700 nm graded layer thickness has been reported with 87.04% strain relaxation.},

We review TTF to place it in the broader nomological net of related constructs. We differentiate task-technology misfit (TTM) from TTF, and we distinguish two types of TTM, ``Too Little″ and ``Too Much.″ Then, we undergo a four-study process to create two satisfactory scales. Finally, we perform two empirical studies to confirm our three-dimensional conceptualization of TTF and TTM in the larger TTF theory framework.},

  abstract  = {Enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects are complex and resource demanding. Some ERP projects fail due to what is called `misfit' between the adopting organization's business requirements and the ERP's functionalities. Existing literature has studied how ERP systems match to different organizations and have argued that there always exists a gap between the business rules embedded in the system, and the practices and processes that exist in organizations. Thus, tailoring might be an important procedure during ERP implementations, in which the ERP customization takes place in order to ensure the compliance with the organizations' critical business processes and requirements. Via an in-depth case study, this research investigates how the different ERP tailoring types defined in literature correspond to different types of misfits identified in an ERP implementation project at a large public organization. The study results suggest that there is a correlation between tailoring types and categories of misfits. In other words, different categories of misfits can be decisive for the type of customization being used. These categories can be organized into four main influences that affect tailoring; strategy, project, system and institution. Moreover, internal institutional factors that are linked to system acceptance, such as culture and resistance could affect tailoring. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

This paper analyses a case study of IT integration in a merger of two large Australian banks, and argues that an understanding of organisational and strategic fit at the level of the IT organisation can contribute to effective management of IT integration. The paper explores the fit within and between two organisational configurations of IT, and the dynamics of their integration. We discuss the contingencies underlying use of different models of IT integration, and suggest that `best of breed' prescriptions may be inappropriate when the IT configurations of merging organisations are incompatible. In which case, an `absorption' strategy can simplify a multi-dimensional misfit and reduce integration complexity.},

In this paper, following an introduction to synchrotron radiation, we describe the capabilities of the IBM/MIT X-ray beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), A range of techniques are introduced, and examples of their applicability to the study of microelectronics-related materials phenomena are described.},

This study intends to advance our knowledge in this area. It first introduces a general framework for technology change in use, developed in an organizational study. Then, through tracking the post-deployment changes of a large workflow application, this study develops an enhanced and expanded categorization of post-deployment IT changes. The findings suggest that even custom-developed software can be plagued by, misfit and that a learning-in-working perspective should be added to understand and resolve the misfit between IT and the organization. For future study, the findings of this study suggest that more efforts should be directed toward the issues of balancing system stability and volatility and continuous post-deployment communication between IT management and users.},

To that end, we start by presenting a hierarchical structure of criteria after reviewing related studies, and dividing the criteria into the categories of project management, organizational management, human-related, organizational and technical. To assess the weight of the criteria in the proposed framework, we collect the opinions of a sample of information technology experts working in different public universities in Iran, using an online questionnaire that is based on the best-worst method (BWM). By analyzing the weight of the criteria, we can reveal that misfit of information systems software (closely followed by lack of top management support and unsuccessful monitoring and measurement) has the greatest impact on the failure of information systems in the public universities of Iran. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used in other countries facing the same problem. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A wireless network consists of a large number of nodes with limited resources. The large number of event data will be generated over a period of time in a wireless network. Also, faced with high resource demand variability and with misfit resource renting policies, the current practices is to overprovision for each game tens of owned data. In a wireless network, the agent node may become easily overloaded by the high demand from the players for updates. So, we propose a hybrid load balancing scheme for games in wireless networks which is based on allocating load on wireless mobile nodes proportionally to each of the agent's capacities. This proposed scheme is a combined dynamic provisioning algorithm based on greedy graph and user-oriented load balancing scheme for maintaining the performance and stability of distributed system in wireless networks. We address the key functions for our proposed scheme and simulate the efficiency of our proposed scheme using mathematical analyses. We then testify that the proposal has best performance compared with previous researches.},

  abstract  = {Michael Jackson's problem frame concept is used to discuss the usability of different method features to design coordination mechanisms. Based on coordination theory and a case we identify three specific coordination frames - the simple coordination frame, the coordination of work frame, and the elaborate coordination of work frame. These frames help us characterize and understand coordination problems. We also present four general frames - the simple IS frame, the simple control frame, the workpieces frame, and the connection frame. These frames explicate different features of contemporary design methods. We compare the coordination frames and the general frames to evaluate the fits and misfits between method features and the challenges involved in designing coordination mechanisms. The analysis provides lessons on two levels. First, we learn about coordination problems and method features that are, or are not, useful to design coordination mechanisms. Second, we learn about problem frames as an approach to software methodology research.},

  abstract = {A homogeneous collection of 45 estrogen agonist derivatives with relative binding affinities measured to the estrogen receptor from Ratus norvegicus was used. The quantitative structure-activity relationships were derived using an improved minimal topologic difference (MTD) method in a partial least-squares (PLS) variant. The spatially assigned analysis of fragment properties can provide receptor site maps, within the limits of the existing series. A steric misfit was found for the steroidal position 2; benefic hydrophobic and van der Waals (enhanced by high polarizability) interactions were found for the 17 alpha-CH=CH-X group. MTD-PLS mapping results are confirmed by the experimentally derived estradiol-estrogen receptor binding site contacts (based on X-ray crystallography). Our results suggest that this MTD-PLS method can yield useful results for interactions with receptors of unknown 3D structure and, generally, for the steric rigidity of receptor sites.},

Disaster management is the concept being applied during disaster in organizing and managing resources and responsibilities of all relevant agencies in the event of disaster. Today, disaster management critically relies on information to ensure all agencies responsible can disseminate information in making a better and effective disaster relief efforts. Based on this motivation, we posit a maturity model that aim to identify the improvement of infostructure for disaster management. Maturity model is commonly used to guide the development of improvement program to transform to a better state, which in this research is to improve the infostructure being used during disaster. An initial conceptual maturity model has been constructed based on selected disaster processes. Based on the literature review, questionnaire items have been designed to form the identified latent constructs. A pilot survey has been conducted to verify the questionnaire items and the results are tested against Rasch measurement analysis. By using Rasch logit measures, the items' quality is ensured. Findings indicate that the item fitness is good, outfit and infit mean square values are very much close to 1, and Z-standardized value is within the expected range. Nonetheless, there are several misfit items which are further calibrated and revised for future study.},

  abstract = {Competing platforms with hardware and content differentiation may adopt a one-way compatibility strategy, in which one platform owner allows its hardware users to purchase the competitor's content service, whereas the competitor does not. Moreover, the platform owners can choose a resale model or agency model. When a platform owner adopts the agency model, a platform-performance investment may force content providers to incur certain costs to ensure enhanced performance. In this paper, we develop a stylized model to investigate the effects of a platform-performance investment on a business-model decision by examining a platform ecosystem that consists of a unit mass of users, a content provider, and two downstream competing platform owners. We find that, when the unit misfit cost of hardware is much less than that of the content, if the royalty rate is too high (low), the agency (resale) model will be adopted by both platform owners. If the royalty rate is neither too high nor too low, the owners will adopt a different business model. When the unit misfit cost of hardware is weakly less than that of the content, the platform owners' business-model decision is jointly determined by the relative platform-performance investment efficiency and the royalty rate. Moreover, when both platform owners adopt the agency model, the price is not always higher than that when they use the resale model due to the negative effect of the performance investment. Finally, we present the condition under which the content provider would be better off if the provider is granted the right to change the business model by one platform owner.},

It systematizes irremediable problems, which appear quite often in the real life but cannot be solved using the regularization method. The paper also shows a new way of solving irremediable inverse problems by a complex memetic approach including: genetic computation with adaptive accuracy, random sample clustering and a sophisticated local approximation of misfit plateau regions. Finally, we use a benchmark function featuring cross-shaped plateau to discuss some factors that influence the quality of plateau shape approximation. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Studies of these features for various values of strain (Ge content) and growth temperature reveal the underlying physical processes determining the strain relaxation. Fourier analysis of AFM images is performed to obtain quantitative roughness information and to separate roughness components of different physical origin.},

We build on the information processing view of the firm to theorize that performance heterogeneity across business process outsourcing (BPO) exchanges is a function of the design of information capabilities (IC) that fit the unique information requirement (IR) of the exchange. Further, we compare performance effects of the fit between IR and IC across dominant categories of BPO relationships to provide insights into the relative benefits of enacting such fit between the constructs. Empirical tests of our hypotheses using survey data on 127 active BPO relationships find a significant increase (decrease) in satisfaction as a result of the fit (misfit) between IR and IC of the relationship. The results have implications for how BPO relationships must be designed and managed to realize significant performance gains. The study also extends the IPV to identify IC that provide the incentives and means to process information in an interfirm relationship.},

  abstract = {Using IT in ways that can trigger major organizational changes creates high-risk, potentially high-reward, situations that I call technochange (for technology-driven organizational change). Technochange differs from typical IT projects and from typical organizational change programs and therefore requires a different approach. One major risk in technochange-that people will not use information technology and related work practices-is not thoroughly addressed by the discipline of IT project management, which focuses on project cost, project schedule, and solution functionality. Organizational change management approaches are also generally not effective on their own, because they take as a given the IT ``solutions″ developed by a technical team. Consequently, the potential for the IT ``solution″ to be misaligned with important organizational characteristics, such as culture or incentives, is great. Merely combining IT project management and organizational change management approaches does not produce the best results, for two reasons. First, the additive approach does not effectively address the many failure-threatening problems that can arise over the lengthy sequential process of the typical technochange lifecycle. Second, the additive approach is not structured to produce the characteristics of a good technochange solution: a complete intervention consisting of IT and complementary organizational changes, an implementable solution with minimal misfits with the existing organization, and an organization primed to appropriate the potential benefits of the technochange solution. With hard work and care, the combined IT project management plus organizational change approach can be made to work. However, an iterative, incremental approach to implementing technochange can be a better strategy in many situations. The essential characteristic of the technochange prototyping approach is that each phase involves both new IT functionality and related organizational changes, such as redesigned business processes, new performance metrics, and training.},

  abstract = {To compete in a highly dynamic marketplace, firms must frequently adapt and align their competitive strategies and information systems. The dominant literature on the strategic fit of a firm's information systems focuses primarily on high-level measures of the strategic fit of a firm's overall IS portfolio and the impact of fit on business performance. This paper addresses the need for a more fine-grained approach for assessing the specific areas of misfit between a firm's competitive strategies and IS capabilities. We describe the design and evaluation of a multilevel strategic fit (MSF) measurement model that enables researchers and practitioners to measure the strategic fit of a firm's information systems at both an overall and a detailed level. The steps in the model include identifying the relevant IS capabilities according to the type of system; measuring the current level of support for each capability using a capabilities instrument; identifying the ideal level of support for each capability using an adaptation of Conant et al.'s (1990) instrument to assess strategic archetype; and comparing the ideal and realized level of support for each capability. Evidence from a multiple case study analysis indicates that the fine-grained assessment of strategic fit can strengthen the validity, utility, and ease of corroboration of the strategic fit measurement outputs. The paper also demonstrates how an iterative design science research approach, with its emphasis on evaluating the utility of prototype artifacts, is well suited to developing field-tested and theoretically grounded measurement models and instruments that are accessible to practitioners. This focus on practical utility in turn provides researchers with results that can be more readily corroborated, thus improving the quality and usefulness of the research findings.},

  abstract  = {For non-linear inverse problems, the mathematical structure of the mapping from model parameters to data is usually unknown or partly unknown. Absence of information about the mathematical structure of this function prevents us from presenting an analytical solution, so our solution depends on our ability to produce efficient search algorithms. Such algorithms may be completely problem-independent (which is the case for the so-called `meta-heuristics' or `blind-search' algorithms), or they may be designed with the structure of the concrete problem in mind. We show that pure meta-heuristics are inefficient for large-scale, non-linear inverse problems, and that the `no-free-lunch' theorem holds. We discuss typical objections to the relevance of this theorem. A consequence of the no-free-lunch theorem is that algorithms adapted to the mathematical structure of the problem perform more efficiently than pure meta-heuristics. We study problem-adapted inversion algorithms that exploit the knowledge of the smoothness of the misfit function of the problem. Optimal sampling strategies exist for such problems, but many of these problems remain hard.},

  abstract  = {Business Process Management (BPM) can be viewed as a set of techniques to integrate, build, and reconfigure an organization's business processes for the purpose achieving a fit with the market environment. While business processes are rather stable in low-dynamic markets, the frequency, quality, and importance of process change amplifies with an increase in environmental dynamics. We show that existing designs of public sector BPM might not be able to cope with the mounting frequency and quality of business process change. Our qualitative in-depth case study of a local government suggests that a major cause for such misfit lies in ineffective organizational learning. We contribute to the literature by applying the Dynamic Capability framework to public sector BPM in order to better understand shifts in market dynamics and their consequences for BPM effectiveness. Practitioners find a proposal for identifying, understanding, and reacting to a BPM-misfit and for developing effective BPM strategies.},

The Langeforsian approach aims to introduce effective methods for information system design and to utilise the potential of computers and information technology in controlling organisations and improving their performance.  The aim of Alexander's approach is to improve architectural design by bridging the gap between designer and users.  Both approaches have given important contributions to design in their fields.  In both approaches graphs and matrices are important tools.  Also, procedures for finding subsystems and components are put forward in both approaches, and the process of design is subdivided.  The two approaches are different with regard to requirements definitions, in the Langeforsian approach goals are crucial, while misfits are focussed in Alexander's approach.  The notions of goals and misfits are examined.  Finally, systems-fit approaches to information system design are discussed.},

Two surveys were conducted first in September 2013 and second in December 2015, based on a questionnaire consisting of items on the Likert scale. As results, the correlation of all the variables between the two surveys is very significant (except for usefulness, for which the relationship is significant). This is not surprising, given previous studied focused on habits and learning related to technology adoption. Nevertheless, the increase is not spectacular and it makes necessary to evaluate EMR satisfaction and perceptions in order to elaborate a measure standard enabling comparisons and benchmarking among hospitals.

While there is research focusing on the classification and impact of different ERP modification strategies, research addressing the cost implication of ERP modifications is still lacking. In this paper, we look at existing literature to classify ERP modification strategies, and then we focus on the issue of evaluating the relative cost of different strategies. We gather the opinion of experts in ERP implementations about the relative cost of alternative strategies using an AHP-based online questionnaire. Based on the results of the data collection, we build cost functions to compare the relative cost of alternative strategies. Our approach represents a first step in quantifying the relative cost of different ERP implementation strategies and can be exploited in decision-making problems related to ERP change and evolution.},

Deciding on the right mix of configuration, customization and process change seems to be very challenging. Understanding how design teams (ERP consultants and organizational representatives) actually decide on the mix has received very little attention within ERP research, however. This paper presents a focus group study on how ERP professionals perceive ERP implementations, and how their perception influences the approach used to implement the ERP system. As a result, four different perceptions of the nature of the design process have been identified. The perceptions manifest themselves as four distinct metaphors used by ERP experts to explain what implementations are about and the nature of the cooperation with the user organization. The research findings imply that the practice preferred by ERP consultants is very likely to result in a narrow focus on the design of the IT-artifact, and that joint optimization of the social and the technical sub-system will very seldom be realized.},

  abstract  = {Support vector regression (SVR) method becomes the state of the art machine learning method for data regression due to its excellent generalization performance on many real-world problems. It is well-known that the standard SVR determines the regressor using a predefined epsilon tube around the data points in which the points lying outside the tube contribute to the errors whereas the inside points are simply ignored. To measure the data misfit as stated, the epsilon insensitive function is introduced as a loss function. In comparison with the popular quadratic loss function, it is robust but only continuous and therefore numerical minimization is difficult. However, as a combination of robust treatment to large errors and showing quadratic treatment to small errors, Huber function is used in the literature to measure the data misfit having the smooth property that it is differentiable everywhere. In this study, we propose a novel robust Huber SVR (HSVR) formulation in primal where the regressor is made as flat as possible by considering the regularization term in L1-norm. Since the regularization term is non-smooth and therefore by replacing it with smooth approximation functions, new problem formulation is obtained which is solved then by functional iterative method. Tests were performed on few synthetic and real world data sets whose results confirm the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed robust model.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that a firm's plural sourcing strategy, which determines how much it chooses to make versus how much it chooses to buy, requires consideration of the complementarities and constraints that affect the differential advantages of making and buying. Elaborating on this perspective, we theorize how (mis)fit between a firm's plural sourcing strategy of simultaneously making and buying and its development of information technology (IT) enabled interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities influences firm performance in deregulated markets. We position our theory development and empirical tests in the context of the power-generation segment of the U.S. electric utility industry (EUI), an asset-intensive industry that has been deregulated to promote the separation of key value chain activities (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution) and the development of wholesale energy markets. We draw on the transaction cost economics, coordination costs, and IT capabilities perspectives to theorize that a firm achieves fit (realizing performance benefits) by increasing market sourcing intensity (MSI)-or, how much it buys relative to how much it makes- and developing IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability for external coordination with the market, or misfit (realizing performance penalties) by increasing MSI and developing IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability for coordinating internal production. We collated data from archival sources for 342 utility firms in the power-generation segment to construct a panel dataset for the period 1994-2004 on (1) firms' MSI from wholesale electricity markets, (2) firms' IT investment decisions to develop interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities, (3) measures of firm performance, and (4) several control variables related to exogenous shocks (i.e., regulatory change, oil crisis), region of operation, and firm-level factors. Our results suggest that fit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves firm profitability, assessed by return on assets, and misfit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability extracts penalties in firm profitability. We also find evidence that fit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves market valuation, assessed by Tobin's Q, and asset turnover, assessed by operating revenue/total assets. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of IT capabilities to accompany a firm's plural sourcing strategy and the literature on IT business value.},

Five potential antecedent factors of adoption were derived from the literature, including that on innovation theories, and data were obtained from a sample of 217 organizations across Australia. A structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to examine the complex relationships between antecedents and the adoption decision. We found that there were three positive drivers of a successful outcome of the ERN adoption stage. Prior findings have shown that system quality is a key enabler for innovation adoption by individuals, and we found that system quality is also an important driver for organizational adoption of ERP. It was also indicated that organizations consider adopting ERN when the market and customer patterns are relatively stable rather than in turbulent environments.},

  abstract = {Transient electromagnetic (TEM) data are conveniently inverted to visualized underground structure with the widely used Occam & x2019;s inversion. However, in sedimentary environments, Occam & x2019;s inversion performs poorly in reproducing the sharp boundaries as it produces smoothed results of subsurface geophysical properties. Here, we develop a simple and robust total variation (TV) based inversion scheme for TEM data to preserve sharp boundaries and improve the accuracy of recovered underground structure. To solve the standard L2-TV optimization problem, we propose a reconstructing minimization (RM) approach. The TV-based inversion scheme is divided into two phases. In Phase I the misfit is brought down to a desired level utilizing Occam & x2019;s inversion. In Phase II we utilize RM approach to implement TV regularization until the convergent result is achieved. Taking advantage of the excellent stability of Occam & x2019;s inversion, the TV-based inversion scheme has the characteristics of robustness to different initial models. The switch process between Occam & x2019;s inversion and the RM approach is rather simple to realize due to their similar solution forms. The synthetic and field data examples validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed TV-based inversion scheme. We further present a novel analysis based on reconstruction of stabilizer to illustrate the reason for their distinctive behaviors of TV-based inversion and Occam & x2019;s inversion.},

The media agenda of public crises is a big part of crisis research as important phenomena in crisis communication. According to surveys of the crisis news in 51 crises between 2003 and 2007, the actuality of media agenda and relevant public cognition are discussed. There are some findings: the intensity of news about crises has been increased in the last five years. There are remarkable misfits between different crises and different news. The conclusion is that current media agenda which makes great influence on public cognition still has some deficiencies to be improved.},

In this paper we describe the use of in situ microscopy for the observation of reactions in silicides and the formation of semiconductor ``quantum dots.'″ The dynamic information obtained from these experiments enables us to understand reaction mechanisms and to suggest improvements to growth and processing techniques. We conclude with a discussion of the use of in situ microscopy for studying reactions such as electrodeposition which occur at liquid/solid interfaces.},

Though that study. focused primarily on drug-like molecules, it also showed that Metal binding led to the greatest ligand efficiencies. Here, the physical limits of binding are examined across the wide variety of small molecules in the Binding MOAD database. The complexes with the greatest ligand efficiencies share the trait of being small, charged ligands bound in highly charged, well buried binding sites. The limit of ligand efficiency is -1.75 kcal/mol.atom for the protein-ligand complexes within Binding MOAD and 95% of the set have efficiencies below a ``soft limit″ of -0.83 kcal/mol.atom. On the basis of buried molecular surface area, the hard limit of ligand efficiency is -117 cal/mol.angstrom(2), which is in surprising agreement with the limit of macromolecule protein binding. Close examination of the most efficient systems reveals their incredibly high efficiency is dictated by tight contacts, between the charged groups Of the ligand and the pocket. In fact, a Misfit of 0.24 angstrom in the average contacts inherently decreases the maximum possible efficiency by at least 0.1 kcal/mol.atom.},

  abstract = {The paper develops and tests theory that explains under what conditions the extent of email use is appraised as a stressor. Integrating concepts from information acquisition and person-environment fit theories, we hypothesize that individuals appraise their extent of email use as stressful based on the mismatch between their current and desired extents of email use. We define the mismatch as email misfit and the match as email fit. We first develop a conceptual framework that associates email misfit with the individual's experience of three key workplace stressors-work relationships stressor, job control stressor, and job conditions stressor. We then develop hypotheses framing the relationship between email fit and misfit, and these stressors. We test our hypotheses by applying quadratic polynomial regressions and surface-response analysis to survey data obtained from 118 working individuals. The paper makes three theoretical contributions. First, in reporting a theoretical and empirical construction of email fit and misfit and their relationship to workplace stressors, it shows that email misfit is appraised as stress-creating. That is, both too much email and too little, compared to what the individual desires, are associated with stressors. Secondly, it shows that IT use (in this case, email) is appraised as stressful both when it exceeds (i.e., associated with overload) and fails to meet (i.e., associated with underload), the user's expectation and preference. Thirdly, this paper suggests the person-environment approach as a theoretically novel way to conceptualize the cognitive appraisal and judgement associated with information underacquisition and overacquisition and shows workplace stressors as potentially new effects associated with them.},

  abstract = {Packaged software applications such as enterprise systems are designed to support generic rather than specific requirements, and hence are likely to be an imperfect fit in any particular instance. Using critical realism as our philosophical perspective, we conducted a three-year qualitative study of misfits that arose from an enterprise system (ES) implementation. A detailed analysis of the observed misfits resulted in a richer understanding of the concept of fit and of the ES artifact itself Specifically, we found six misfit domains (functionality, data, usability, role, control and organizational culture) and within each, two types of misfit (deficiencies and impositions). These misfit types correspond to two newly defined types of fit: fit as coverage and fit as enablement. Our analysis of fit also revealed a new conceptualization of the ES artifact, with implications for IT artifacts in general.},

However, the influence of technology on career related outcomes of IT professionals is at best limited. Using the P-E fit perspective, the present study investigated the implications of the perceived fit/misfit between the expected and the experienced career growth and work-life balance from the technology the IT professionals are working in on their career satisfaction. Based on response surface methodology and polynomial regression analysis of the data collected from 286 IT professionals, the study found that not only the fit, but also the misfit between expected and experienced technology led career growth and work-life balance is important in explaining career satisfaction. Implications of the study for both research and practice were discussed.},

In this paper, we address these problems by incorporating first order tensor information into the tensor voting formalism, which is second-order based To propagate an adaptive smoothness constraint at a preferred orientation non-iteratively, we vote for a first order tensor (or vector) to capture polarity and orientation information. To integrate first and second order tensors, we propose an algorithm for inferring the proper scale based on the continuity constraint, and preserving the finest details. Given a noisy 3-D point set, the new and improved formalism can better localize boundary curves and orientation discontinuities. Unlike many approaches that over-smooth features, or delay the handling of boundaries and discontinuities until model misfit occurs, the interaction of smooth features, boundaries, discontinuities, outliers are encoded at the representation level.

  abstract = {This paper presents a control strategy for a power generation plant based in solid oxide fuel cells. The strategy establishes a stationary regime of operation for the fuel cell using a small battery bank to absorb the dynamic characteristics of the power demand. In order to make the control strategy the methods of genetic algorithms was used as optimization tool for determining the optimal point in the stationary regime. With the control strategy adopted is achieved a bigger efficiency of the equipment due to the absence of misfits in the operation parameters. This methodology also promotes an increase in life cycle and reduction the volume and cost of equipment due to operation at the point of maximum efficiency. A simulation structure was made to test the solutions developed and proposed configuration. The capability of dynamic response was evaluated with this structure introducing operations conditions based on a residential power demand.},

We performed a sensitizing diary study followed by a user experience evaluation comparing sleep-tracking features of the Fitbit Flex, Jawbone Up, Misfit Shine, and Polar Loop products with six users. We summarize their findings in three recommendations for sleep-tracking functionalities: find the right balance between automation and control, make data intelligible for users, and acknowledge the role of emotions. These design recommendations should make sleep trackers more transparent, and thus more usable and useful to the users in their endeavor to sleep well.},

An ERP system is the outcome of social processes, and different ERP systems can embody distinct social arrangements when developed in different cultural contexts. Such social arrangements are difficult to change due the closure effect of technology stabilization. This leads to various misfit problems, both during and after ERP implementation, causing adverse effects on delivered ERP quality. With a survey of 85 ERP implementation cases in Taiwan, this study derives and empirically tests the main as well as the interaction effects of the country of origin of the ERP package, consultant quality, top management support, and user support of the ERP system quality as perceived by the client after implementation. The results demonstrate the important role of the country of origin of the ERP package and consultant quality in configuring a high-quality ERP system and alleviating the negative effect of misfit problems.},

There are many consumer-based wristband monitors on the market, but there is not an unified method to compare their performance. In this paper, we designed a series of experiments testing step counting performance under different walking conditions to evaluate these wristband activity monitors. Seven popular brands, including Huawei B1, Mi Band, Fitbit Charge, Polar Loop, Garmin Vivofit2, Misfit Shine, and Jawbone Up, were selected and evaluated with the proposed experiment method in this paper. These experiments include four parts, which are walking in a field at a different walking speed with and without arm swing, walking along a specified complex path, walking on a treadmill, and walking up and down stairs. Experiment results and analysis with nine healthy subjects were reported to show the step counting performance of these seven monitors.},

  abstract = {The unique features of current and upcoming energy systems, namely, high penetration of uncertain renewables, unpredictable customer participation, and purposeful manipulation of meter readings, all highlight the need for fast and robust power system state estimation (PSSE). In the absence of noise, PSSE is equivalent to solving a system of quadratic equations, which, also related to power flow analysis, is NP-hard in general. Assuming the availability of all power flow and voltage magnitude measurements, this paper first suggests a simple algebraic technique to transform the power flows into rank-one measurements, for which the \$\ell _1\$-based misfit is minimized. To uniquely cope with the nonconvexity and nonsmoothness of \$\ell _1\$-based PSSE, a deterministic proximal-linear solver is developed based on composite optimization, whose generalization using stochastic gradients is discussed too. This paper also develops conditions on the \$\ell _1\$-based loss function such that exact recovery and quadratic convergence of the proposed scheme are guaranteed. Simulated tests using several IEEE benchmark test systems under different settings corroborate our theoretical findings, as well as the fast convergence and robustness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract = {We use a game-theoretic model to examine how information personalization by firms interacts with different dimensions of product differentiation (namely, horizontal and vertical differentiation). We consider the possibility that consumers attach different importance to various types of product differentiation, and report the equilibrium in terms of the ``quality-fit″ ratio, which measures the relative strength of preference for quality compared to preference for product fit and is a function of the cost of quality and the cost of product misfit. We also consider how different market structures (whether firms are similar or differentiated on the horizontal dimension ex ante) lead to different equilibriums when firms adopt personalization. We show that personalization by one firm leads to higher profits for both firms if product quality and misfit costs are high and the firms offer similar products ex ante. On the other hand, if firms offer differentiated products, personalization is profitable only if the effectiveness of the personalization technology is high or if both product quality and misfit costs are low. We also highlight conditions under which investments in personalization and product quality can be complements or Substitutes to each other. Finally, we show that a firm can respond to a competitor's personalization by either increasing (aggressive response) or decreasing (defensive response) investments in its own quality. Our results provide insights to managers on when to invest in personalization technologies and how to adjust their investments in product quality after the firm (or its competitor) adopts personalization.},

  abstract = {Commercial off-the-shelf ERP systems have been adopted by many large companies to support their inter- and intra-business processes. Midsize market firms are now also investing their use. However, research has indicated that about three quarters of attempted ERP projects are unsuccessful: a common problem encountered in adopting ERP software has been the issue of fit or alignment. This paper presents an ERP selection methodology, grounded in task-technology fits theory, for measuring, at a high-level, the misfit between ERP candidates and the enterprise's requirements ex-ante implementation. With this approach, organizations can more easily and systematically determine the locations of possible misfit and their degree of importance, thereby understanding the risk in their implementing an ERP.

The melting temperature is a suitable parameter used to evaluating the stability of DNA duplex. Traditional method to predict Tin in biological engineering may exist lager error for a few sequences. Thus it misfits the lager amount of DNA sequences in DNA computing. In this paper, we introduced artificial neural network to predict the Tin based on Next-Nearest-Neighbor model. Our result shows that the methods have a higher precision than TP methods based on nearest-neighbor model.},

  abstract = {We investigate the use of linear adaptation when fusing Wi-Fi maps built from spatially sparse received signal strength measurements obtained with multiple devices. First, we show that the residual of the linear regression between devices, usually unaccounted for in existing cross-device localization work, is an important indicator of device dissimilarity and a good predictor of localization performance. Through explicitly modeling the device dissimilarity, one can improve localization accuracy when fusing training sets from multiple devices by weighting each training set differently. Second, we use the Gaussian process ( GP) sensor model to develop a regression algorithm which more reliably estimates the linear fit and device dissimilarity given only a few labeled samples from each new device. By accounting for device dissimilarities in map fusion and by using the proposed regression algorithm, localization performance can be greatly improved given just a few training samples from a new device. Also, when fusing multiple existing maps for a new device using regression misfit, performance is improved by 3.5 to 10 percent.},

  abstract  = {Traditional clustering algorithms often suffer from model misfit problem when the distribution of real data does not fit the model assumptions. To address this problem, we propose a novel clustering framework based on adaptive space mapping and rescaling, referred as M-R framework. The basic idea of our approach is to adjust the data representation to make the data distribution fit the model assumptions better. Specifically, documents are first mapped into a low dimensional space with respect to the cluster centers so that the distribution statistics of each cluster could be analyzed on the corresponding dimension. With the statistics obtained in hand, a rescaling operation is then applied to regularize the data distribution based on the model assumptions. These two steps are conducted iteratively along with the clustering algorithm to constantly improve the clustering performance. In our work, we apply the M-R framework on the most widely used clustering algorithm, i.e. k-means, as an example. Experiments on well known datasets show that our M-R framework can obtain comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Coded caching has been shown to significantly reduce traffic load for wireless content delivery by creating coded multicasting opportunities. However, its order-optimal memory-load tradeoff performance requires the file size to go to infinity or grow exponentially with the number of users. This letter introduces a new delivery scheme for decentralized cache placement in practical settings with finite file packetization. The main idea is to characterize the fitness level of each pair of mergable packets, then choose the packet pair with the minimum misfit value for coded multicasting in a greedy and sequential manner. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme attains the lowest traffic load among all existing schemes at all values of file size and cache size with polynomial complexity.},
