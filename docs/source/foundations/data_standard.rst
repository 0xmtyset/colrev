Data standard
====================================


Main records standard (providing guidance on how to convert data from searchsources):

TBD: required vs identifying?! (masterdata/data provenance)

- ENTRYTYPE (categories) and required fields
- Field names (keys) principle: lower case, underscore
- Field values (identifying vs. non-identifying)

Provide information on where it is in the code
