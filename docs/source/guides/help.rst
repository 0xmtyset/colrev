Help
==================================

We are here to help you and others who may struggle with the same issue.
Here's how you can help us help you.

Identify the source
------------------------------

CoLRev orchestrates many powerful libraries and data sources.
In addition, the setup of your local machine and the local CoLRev environment may prevent us from replicating the issue.
We need your help in narrowing down the source of the issue.
For example,

- Errors in *colrev load* may be caused by the zotero translators
- Errors in *colrev prep* may result from several metadata sources or preparation scripts. We recommend to run *colrev prep -d RECORD_ID* for the erroneous record to track down the error.

Create a minimum reproducible example
------------------------------------------

To solve issues efficiently, minimum reproducible examples are given priority. We also focus on bugs that occur in the latest version because CoLRev is developing quickly.

Check prior documentation and file the issue
----------------------------------------------

Please check prior issues in the `issue tracker <https://github.com/geritwagner/colrev_core/issues>`__ and run a quick Google search for possible solutions.

You can ask questions on `Stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_, using the colrev tag.

You can also file a bug report in the `issue tracker <https://github.com/geritwagner/colrev_core/issues>`__ or propose a solution by opening a pull request.
