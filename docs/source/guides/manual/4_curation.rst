4. Curation
==================================

If you already completed a literature review project, it is very easy to set it up as a curation.

This enables you to reuse record-level data within other local projects, within a research team, or across the research community.

Literature reviews are much more efficient, accurate, and rich if you rely on curated community repositories (e.g., reuse of prepared metadata, duplicate matchings, PDF hashes).
Search available curations on `GitHub <https://github.com/topics/colrev-curation>`_, add curated repositories, and help create a reuse-index:

.. code-block:: bash

      colrev env --install https://github.com/u_name/repo_name
      colrev env --index

See `reuse of community-curated data <../technical_documentation/colrev.html#reuse>`_ for details.
