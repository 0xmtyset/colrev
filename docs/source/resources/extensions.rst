Extensions
====================================

Extensions of CoLRev are available on `Github <https://github.com/topics/colrev-extension>`_ and guidelines on extension development are available in `this section <architecture/extension_development.html>`_.
A few examples are summarized below.


colrev_endpoint
-----------------

The :program:`colrev_cml_endpoint` extension is aimed at making it easy to integrate other tools by operating endtpoints that support the export and loading of data.
For example, EndPoint supports the collaboration with Endnote (and other reference mangers) or ASReview for the prescreen.

paper-feed
-----------------

The :program:`paper_feed` extension is aimed at providing a continuous feed of recent research by retrieving (new) papers from databases like Crossref and DBLP.
It's vision is to facilitate **living reviews** in which researchers can efficiently disseminate the latest publications and distribute them to their local topic (CoLRev) repositories and projects.
