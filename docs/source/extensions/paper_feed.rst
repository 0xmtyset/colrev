PaperFeed
==================================

The :program:`paper_feed` extension is aimed at providing a continuous feed of recent research by retrieving (new) papers from databases like Crossref and DBLP.
It's vision is to facilitate "living reviews" in which researchers can efficiently disseminate the latest publications and distribute them to their local topic (CoLRev) repositories.
